They describe an approach to abstraction of probabilistic and dynamic systems. They obtain abstract Golog programs that omit unnecessary details and which can be translated back to a detailed program for actual execution. This simplifies the implementation of noisy robot programs, opens up the possibility of using deterministic reasoning methods (e.g., planning) on probabilism problems, and provides domain descriptions that are more easily understandable and explainable."}
