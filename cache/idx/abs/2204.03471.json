Most RL methods use fixed action interval (denoted as tduration) and actuate or maintain a phase every tduration, which makes the phase duration less dynamic and flexible. They propose DynLight-C that adopts a well trained deep Q-network of DynLight and replace M-QL by a fixed cyclical control policy that actuate a set of phases in fixed order to realize cyclical phase structure."}
