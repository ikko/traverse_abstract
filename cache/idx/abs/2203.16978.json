They show the following results. In the results, they show that the problem is solved by factorization matrices. They also show that factorization problems are solved by using a factorization matrix of matrices with a polynomic matrix. They conclude that the result is the result of factorizing matrices matrices for a linear algebra matrices. They then conclude that this is a result of the factization problem."}
