ZETAR, a zero-trust audit and recommendation framework, provides a quantitative approach to model incentives of insiders and design customized and strategic recommendation policies to improve their compliance. They create a theoretical underpinning for understanding trust and compliance, and it leads to security insights.\n This work proposes finite-step algorithms to efficiently learn the CT policy set when employees' incentives are unknown. They present a case study to corroborate the design and illustrate a formal way to achieve compliance for insiders with different risk attitudes. The results show that the optimal recommendation policy leads to a significant improvement in compliance for risk-averse insiders."}
