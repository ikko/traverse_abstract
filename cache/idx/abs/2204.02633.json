In light of this, they introduce three data augmentation schemes that help reduce underfitting problems of large-scale language models. Data Augmentation with Generation And Modification (DAGAM) combines DAG and DAM techniques for a boosted performance. They conduct data augmentmentation for six benchmark datasets of text classification task, and verify the usefulness of DAG, DAM, and DAGAM through fine-tuning and evaluation."}
