This paper demonstrates the potential to automate staged rollout with multi-objective reinforcement learning to dynamically balance stakeholder needs such as time to deliver new features and downtime incurred by failures due to latent defects. The potential to automated staged rollout is to be considered in the context of multiple product or process metrics, such as the product and process metrics."}
