The appropriate selection of what to transfer can vastly improve a transfer's results. The BIRCH algorithm is selected for this purpose. Results underline the approaches' applicability caused by its results' reproducibility and practical indifference to sequence, size and dimensionality of (sub-)datasets to be clustered sequentially.", "image": "images/_pdf_2204.01620.png", "filename": "_list_cs.AI_recent.html", "theme": "Artificial Intelligence"}
