They make two contributions to the study of beam search. They show how to make beam search monotonic; that is, they provide a variant that guarantees non-increasing solution cost as the beam width is increased. They also show how using distance-to-go estimates can allow beam search to find better solutions more quickly in domains with non-uniform costs."}
