DOME does not require prior task or object knowledge, and can perform the task in novel object configurations and with distractors. They show that DOME achieves near 100% success rate on 7 real-world everyday tasks, and they perform several studies to thoroughly understand each individual component of DOME to understand each component of the DOME system."}
