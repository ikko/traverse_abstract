In the case of humans and artificial AI agents operating in the same environment, they note the significance of comprehension and response to the actions or capabilities of a human from an agent's perspective. They investigate the use of cognitively inspired models of behavior to predict the behavior of both human and AI agents. The predicted behavior, and associated performance with respect to a certain goal, is used to delegate control."}
