The community has leveraged model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to devise efficient, scalable controllers. This review aims to provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art in distributed MARL for multi-rob cooperation. The review is focused on the state of the art in distributed MarL for multiboot cooperation."}
