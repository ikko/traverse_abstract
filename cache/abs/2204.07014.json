They present state-of-the-art results for subject suggestion and gap filling measured on a standard benchmark. They interpret the table using the knowledge base to suggest new rows and generate metadata like headers through property linking. To improve candidate diversity, they synthesize additional rows using free text generation via GPT-3. They exploit the metadata they interpret to produce better prompts for text generation. Finally, they verify that the additional synthesized content can be linked to a trusted web source such as Wikipedia."}
