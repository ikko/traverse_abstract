They contribute to a broader view on path finding by injecting a natural fairness aspect. They seek to find short paths where all colors should appear with roughly the same frequency. Among other results, they prove the introduced problems to be computationally hard (NP-hard and parameterized hard with respect to the number of colors), while also presenting an encouraging algorithmic result (\"fixed-parameter tractability\") related to the length of the sought solution path\""}
