In recent years, studies have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by tuning the model training strategy. However, how modifications applied to datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question. To fill this gap, in this study, they evaluate if data-centric approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficient. The results call for research agenda that focuses on data-centered techniques, to further enable and democratize Green AI."}
