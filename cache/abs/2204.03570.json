This may mean monitoring and managing the infrastructure (e.g., traffic roads, traffic signals, etc.) However, currently, ITS is also targeting the management of demand. Artificial intelligence plays an important role, especially with the advances in machine learning that translates in the use of computational vision, connected and autonomous vehicles, agent-based simulation, among others. People who are avoiding public transportation are only contributing to an increase in vehicular traffic."}
