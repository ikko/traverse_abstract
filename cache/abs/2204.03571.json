The limited existing work on NSP mining relies on frequentist and downward closure property-based pattern selection, producing large and redundant NSPs, nonactionable for business decision-making. This work makes the first attempt for actionable NSP discovery. It builds an NSP graph representation, quantify both explicit occurrence-based element and pattern relations."}
