The ultimate benefit is improved access to video datasets, e.g. in healthcare settings. Recent literature has proposed deep network-based architectures to perform facial swaps. However, there is not much reporting on how well these methods preserve the types of semantic information needed for the privatized videos to remain useful for their intended application. The main contribution is a novel end-to-end face swapping pipeline for recorded videos of standardized assessments of autism symptoms in children."}
