Flexible Goal Accuracy is a generalized version of JGA. Unlike JGA, it tries to give penalized rewards to mispredictions that are locally correct i.e. the root cause of the error is an earlier turn. FGA considers the performance of both cumulative and turn-level prediction flexibly and provides a better insight than the existing metrics."}
