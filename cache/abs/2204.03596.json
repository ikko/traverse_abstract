On an actual robot, the user needs to consider low-level details, such as enabling and disabling hardware components, e.g., a camera to detect objects for grasping. In this paper, they propose to make these constraints explicit by modeling them as MTL formulas. This allows the user to focus on the high level behavior without the need to."}
