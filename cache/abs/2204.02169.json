It proposes that perceptual beliefs are furnished by sequentially minimising \"prediction errors\" the differences between predicted and observed data. The idea that perception requires multiple cycles of neural activity is at odds with evidence that several aspects of visual perception arise from initial \"feedforward sweep\" that occurs on fast timescales.\n Hybrid predictive coding offers a new perspective on the functional relevance of the feedforward and recurrent activity observed during visual perception. They show that the resulting scheme can be implemented in a biologically plausible neural architecture that approximates Bayesian Bayesian inference utilising local Hebbian update rules."}
