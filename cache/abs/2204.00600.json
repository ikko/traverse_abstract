They characterize the complexity of universal traversal, where the goal is to traverse every gadget at least once, for DAG gadgets, one-state gadgets, and reversible deterministic gadgets. They also study the. complexity of reconfiguration, where. the goal. is to bring the system of gadgets to a specified state, proving many cases PSPACE-complete."}
