The goal is to select at most $k$ time intervals for each. such that all time-edges are covered and (depending on the problem variant) either the maximum interval length or the total sum of interval lengths is minimized. They study a variant of Vertex Cover on temporal graphs -graphs whose edge set changes over discrete time steps."}
