In each case, they prove that the generalized game with that mechanic is polynomial, NP-complete or NP-hard. In the process they give an overview of many of the hardness proof techniques developed for video games over the past decade: the motion-planning-through-gadgets framework, the planar doors framework, and the collectible tokens and toll roads / Hamiltonicity framework."}
