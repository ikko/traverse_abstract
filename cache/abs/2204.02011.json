They propose to train the sequential recommenders as discriminators rather than generators. A generator, as an auxiliary model, is trained jointly with the discriminator to sample plausible alternative next items. The trained discriminator is considered as the final SR model and denoted as \\modelname. Experiments conducted on fthe datasets demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach."}
