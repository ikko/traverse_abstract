Entity Walks and Property Walks for RDF2vec", "image": "abstract.png", "theme": "Artificial Intelligence", "summary": " RDF2vec is a knowledge graph embedding mechanism which first extracts sequences from knowledge graphs by performing random walks. In this poster, they introduce two new flavors of walk extraction coined e-walks and p-walks, which put an emphasis on the structure or the neighborhood of an entity respectively, and thereby allow for creating embeddings which focus on similarity or relatedness. They conduct a preliminary evaluation with a total of 12 variants of the algorithm with the help of CBOW and skip-gram word2vec."}
