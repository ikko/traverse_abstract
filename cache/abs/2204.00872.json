Then, contrarily to the traditional time series approach in which the most recent observations are taken as the calibration sample, they estimate autoregressive models only for data in these sub periods. They observe a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy compared to commonly used approaches, including the Autoregressive Hybrid Nearest Neighbors (ARHNN)"}
