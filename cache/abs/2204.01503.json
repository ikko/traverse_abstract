The general program sequence and examples of filling a unit cube, a parallelepiped, and a concave domain between two hemispherical surfaces, are presented. A sample application to the numerical modeling of bond formation between particles heated by a laser beam in powder bed 3D printing process is considered. The program sequence is presented."}
