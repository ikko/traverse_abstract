RSPO is able to discover a wide spectrum of strategies in a variety of domains, ranging from single-agent particle-world tasks and MuJoCo continuous control to multi-agent stag-hunt games and StarCraftII challenges. For trajectories with high likelihood under existing policies, RSPo utilizes an intrinsic diversity reward to promote exploration. Experiments show that RSPOP can be used in a wide range of domains."}
