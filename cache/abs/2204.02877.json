However, the notorious weakness in generalization among environments prevent widespread application of DRL agents in real-world scenarios. In this paper, they propose Policy Adaptation with Decoupled Representations (PAnDR) for fast policy adaptation. The experiments show that PAnDR outperforms existing algorithms in several representative policy adaptation problems. In offline training phase, the environment representation and policy representation are learned through contrastive learning and policy recovery."}
