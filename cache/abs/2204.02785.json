In this paper they focus on agent-based models, which uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train the agent how to act in its environment. They find that the RL agent handily beats a single opponent, and still performs quite well when the number of opponents are increased. Interestingly, the optimal strategy for playing multiple opponents is almost the complete opposite of the optimal strategies for playing a one opponent. They also analyze the agent and look at what strategies it has arrived by looking at the actions that it has given the highest and lowest Q-values."}
