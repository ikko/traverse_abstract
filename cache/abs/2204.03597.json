IMPLANT significantly outperforms benchmark imitation learning approaches on standard control environments and excels at zero-shot generalization when subject to challenging perturbations in test-time dynamics. Empirically, they demonstrate that IMPLAN significantly outperform benchmark imitation. learning approaches to generalization outperforms benchmarks."}
