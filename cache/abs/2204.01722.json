They use performance models and numerical experiments to demonstrate that high-order methods greatly reduce the costs to reach engineering tolerances while enabling effective use of GPUs. They investigate accuracy, cost, and execution time on multi-node CPU and GPU systems for moderate to large models. They discuss efficient matrix-free representation of Jacobians and how automatic differentiation enables rapid development of nonlinear material models without impacting debuggability and workflows targeting GPUs."}
