They show that it is possible to build a program synthesizer that is both pragmatic and efficient by approximating the joint distribution of programs with a product of independent factors, and performing pragmatic inference on each factor separately. This factored distribution approximates the exact joint distribution well when the examples are given pragmatically, and is compatible with a basic neuro-symbolic program synthesis algorithm. Surprisingly, they find that the synthesizer assuming a factored approximation performs better than a synthesizer."}
