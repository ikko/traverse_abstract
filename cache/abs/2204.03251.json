For low-resource languages such as Filipino, existing wordnets are old and outdated, and producing new ones may be slow and costly in terms of time and resources. In this paper, they propose an automatic method for constructing a wordnet from scratch using only an unlabeled corpus and a sentence embeddings-based language model. Using this, they produce FilWordNet, a new wordnet that supplants and improves the outdated Filipino WordNet."}
