The core decisions in restoration planning are to partition the grid into a few sub-networks, each of which has an initial power source for black-start (called sectionalization problem) and then restart the generators and pick up the loads in each network (called generator startup sequencing problem or GSS) in a parallel fashion, aiming to restore electric service in shortest time."}
