Engineering applications for modeling, characterization, design, and control of such large-scale systems often rely on dimensionality reduction to make solutions computationally tractable in real-time. They propose a general framework called Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) that enables a mesh-agnostic, low-rank representation. NIF consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons: (i) ShapeNet, (ii) ParameterNet, which accounts for any other input complexity, including parametric dependencies, time, and sensor measurements."}
