Different metro stations, e.g. transfer stations and non-transfer stations, have unique traffic patterns. They propose a spatio-temporal node embedding representation module to capture the traffic patterns of different stations. They employ a dynamic graph relationship learning module to learn dynamic spatial relationships between metro stations without a predefined graph adjacency matrix. Extensive experiments are conducted based on metro data in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Hangzhou."}
