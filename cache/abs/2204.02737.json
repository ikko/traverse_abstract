Since the algorithm does not need any training dataset, it is able to learn to work with any logical foundation, even when there is no body of proofs or even conjectures available. The approach is stronger than training on randomly generated data but weaker than the approaches trained on tailored axiom and conjecture sets. It however allows us to apply machine learning to automated theorem proving for many logics, such as intuitionistic logic or linear logic."}
