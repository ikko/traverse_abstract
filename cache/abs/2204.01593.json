They proposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply the method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations using WSIs from three cancer types.\n The unsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows identification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores. Other tissue types in the tumor micro-environment may provide better prediction ability for gene mutations than tumor tissues."}
