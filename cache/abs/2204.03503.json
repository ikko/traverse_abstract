Recent progress in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning has largely influenced the field of ASAG. Deep learning impacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as they noticed that the learned representations alone do not contribute to achieve the best results, but they rather work in a complementary way with hand-engineered features. They structure the analysis of deep learning methods along three categories: word embeddings, sequential models, and attention-based methods."}
