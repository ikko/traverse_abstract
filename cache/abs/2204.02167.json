Disorders of coronary arteries lead to severe health problems such as atherosclerosis, angina, heart attack and even death. The result is an IUQ methodology to calibrate a model with uncertain parameters and a microscale agent-based model of arterial tissue, which produces mechanical behavithe in line with the experimental data, according to the authors of the study."}
