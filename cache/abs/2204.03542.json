They investigate the usage of the native GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) model, together with two in-context learning customizations that inject conceptual definitions and a limited number of samples in a few shot-learning fashion. The results highlight the potential of the approach and the usefulness of the incontext learning. It also highlight the challenge posed by control flow relations for which further training needs to be devised."}
