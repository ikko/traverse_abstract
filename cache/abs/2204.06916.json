Measuring Appropriate Reliance in Human-AI Decision-Making", "image": "images/_pdf_2204.06916.png", "theme": "Artificial Intelligence", "summary": " Many important decisions in daily life are made with the help of advisors, e.g., decisions about medical treatments or financial investments. Advice generated by AI is judged by a human and either deemed reliable or rejected. Recent work has shown that AI advice is not always beneficial, as humans have shown to be unable to ignore incorrect AI advice, essentially representing an over-reliance on AI. They propose to view AR as a two-dimensional construct that measures the ability to discriminate advice quality and behave accordingly."}
