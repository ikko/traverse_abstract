They compare the performance of humans and agents in a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm in which tasks are generated from abstract rules.\n A widely-used meta-reinforcement learning agent performs worse on the abstract tasks than the matched metamers. The work provides a foundation for characterizing differences between humans and machine learning that can be used in future work towards developing machines with human-like behavior."}
