The utility of this approach is shown with applications: a zero-shot methodology to visualize groups of hoaxes and profiling authors spreading disinformation. The motivation is to provide a powerful resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to tackling the spreading of misinformation in this platform."}
