Unlike previous approaches designed for short video retrieval, the approach aims to retrieve minute-long videos that capture complex human actions. They propose to replace parts of the video with compact audio cues that succinctly summarize dynamic audio events and are cheap to process. The method, named ECLIPSE (Efficient CLIP with Sound Encoding), adapts the popular CLIP model to a video setting. It is 2.92x faster and 2.34x memory-efficient than video-only approaches."}
