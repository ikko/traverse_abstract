Such a tree defines a Boolean function in a natural way. They focus on the randomized decision tree complexity of such functions. They prove lower bounds of the form $c(k,n)^d$, where $d$ is the depth of the tree. They also treat trees with alternating levels of AND and OR gates separately and show asymptotically optimal bounds."}
