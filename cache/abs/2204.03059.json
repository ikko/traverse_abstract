It can also be used to predict the demand for emergency management resources. Sensor networks have grown in popularity in data collection and processing capabilities for a variety of applications in industries such as medical, environmental monitoring, home automation etc. Semantic sensor networks can collect various climatic circumstances like wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity. The proposed fire management system acts according to the situation, supports reasoning and the general semantics of the open-world followed by all the."}
