EGT2 learns local entailment relations by recognizing possible textual entailment between template sentences formed by typed CCG-parsed predicates. It then uses three novel soft transitivity constraints to consider the logical transitivity in entailment structures. They propose a two-stage method to alleviate the sparsity issue and lead to significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods."}
