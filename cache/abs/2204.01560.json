However, these systems could be vulnerable to input perturbations, i.eadversarial attacks. They propose a novel learning framework, RobustSense, to defend common attacks. It aims to achieve consistent predictions regardless of whether there exists an attack on its input.\n This is the first work to investigate adversarial attacks and further develop a novel defense framework for wireless human activity recognition in mobile computing research. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly enhance the model robustness of existing deep models, overcoming possible attacks. The results validate that the method works well on wireless human. activity recognition and person identification systems.", "image": "images/_pdf_2204.01560.png", "filename": "_list_cs.AI_recent.html", "theme": "Artificial Intelligence"}
