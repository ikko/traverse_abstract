They investigate the round complexity of the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on circulant graphs, i.e. on Cayley graphs of the cyclic group. They prove that the number of rounds until stabilization is bounded by $d(n)$. As a particular consequence, the problem can be tested in NC for connected circularant graphs of order $p^\\ell$ with $p$ an odd prime."}
