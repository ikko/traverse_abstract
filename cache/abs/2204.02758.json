They consider bag-TIDBs where they have a bound $c$ on the maximum multiplicity of each tuples. They develop a sampling algorithm that computes a 1$\\pm\\epsilon$ approximation of an output tuples in time linear in the runtime of the corresponding deterministic query for any $RA^+$ query. They proceed to study approximation of expected result tuples multiplicities for positive relational algebra queries ($RA*+$) over c-TIDS."}
