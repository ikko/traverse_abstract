They show that a simple sequential tagging model based only on the text within a document achieves high results against a simple classification model. Improvements can be achieved through additional sentence-level features, though these were minimal. Through further analysis, they show the potential of the sequential model relying on the structure of the document depending on the academic discipline which the document is from. They also show that the model can be used to summarise the content of a scientific article."}
