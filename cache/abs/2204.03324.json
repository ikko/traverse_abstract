Understanding commonsense knowledge about the world expressed in text is one of the foundational and challenging problems to create such intelligent systems. ALMEn is an Autoencoding Language Model based Ensemble learning method for commonsense validation and explanation. The method outperforms state-of-the-art models, reaching 97.9% and 95.4% accuracy on the validation and. explanation selection subtasks, respectively."}
