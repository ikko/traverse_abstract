Direct modeling leads to memory explosion because second-order score tensors have sizes of $O(n^3L^2)$ ($n$ is the sentence length and the number of labels), which is not affordable. To tackle this computational challenge, they leverage tensor decomposition techniques. They show that the large second order score tensor. tensor. tensors. have no need to be materialized during mean.field inference, thereby reducing the computational complexity from cubic to quadratic."}
