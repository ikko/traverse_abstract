They collect 80k demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k for Pick&Place, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. They develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure -connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale."}
