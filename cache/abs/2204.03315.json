They revisit ideas presented by Lugosch et al. using speech pre-training and threemodule modeling. They use as the phoneme module an open-source acoustic-phonetic model from a DNN-HMM hybrid automatic speech recognition system instead of training one from scratch. They fine-tune on speech only for the word module, and they apply multi-target learning (MTL) on the word and intent modules to jointly optimize SLU performance."}
