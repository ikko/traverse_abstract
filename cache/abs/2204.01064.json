This renders the control and optimization of such systems a complex task due to their nonlinear behavithe. Standard methods such as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for many systems. For this reason, they propose a new deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a nonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear representation. They demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation accurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wider range of conditions than standard linearization."}
