They propose that a new Science of Disinformation is needed, one which creates a theoretical framework both for the processes of communication and consumption of false content.\n Key scientific and technological challenges facing this research agenda are listed and discussed in the light of state-of-art technologies for fake media generation and detection, argument finding and construction, and how to effectively engage users in the prevention and cure processes. Key scientific challenges facing the research agenda include how to engage users with the prevention, cure and prevention processes."}
