Among these games, DouDizhu, a popular card game in China, is very challenging due to the imperfect information, large state space, elements of collaboration and a massive number of possible moves from turn to turn. With the integration of the above two techniques into DouZero, the system achieves better performance and ranks top in the Botzone leaderboard among more than 400 AI agents, including DouZero."}
