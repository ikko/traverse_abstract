It attains gains up to 9.2% and 14.5% in average on zero-shot recognition benchmarks over the language-image contrastive learning and supervised learning methods. In linear probe setting, it also boosts the performance over the two methods by 7.3% and 3.4%. UniCL rivals the methods across three image classification datasets and two types of vision backbones."}
