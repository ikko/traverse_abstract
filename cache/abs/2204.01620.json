The appropriate selection of what to transfer can vastly improve a transfer's results. The BIRCH algorithm is selected for this purpose. Results underline the approaches' applicability caused by its results' reproducibility and practical indifference to sequence, size and dimensionality of (sub-)datasets to be clustered sequentially."}
