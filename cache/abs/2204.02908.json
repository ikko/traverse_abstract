They propose a two-step model (HTA-WTA) that takes advantage of previous datasets and can generate questions for a specific targeted comprehension skill. They show that the HTA-wTA model tests for strong SCRS by asking deep inferential questions. They also propose a new reading comprehension dataset that contains questions annotated with story-based reading comprehension skills (SBRCS), allowing for a more complete reader assessment."}
