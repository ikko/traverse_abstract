The wide variety of signs and the constant need to add new ones on production environments makes it infeasible to use traditional classification techniques. They propose a novel Contrastive Transformer-based model, which demonstrate to learn rich representations from body key points sequences, allowing better comparison between vector embedding. This allows us to apply these techniques to perform one-shot or few-shot tasks, such as classification and translation."}
