BiSyn-GAT+ fully exploits the syntax information (e.g., phrase segmentation and hierarchical structure) of the constituent tree of a sentence to model the sentiment-aware context of every single aspect and the sentiment relations across aspects. Experiments on fthe benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiSyn GAT+ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently."}
