It combines a collocated formulation for the contact surfaces with a standard Galerkin treatment of the bulk. The CCS approach does not need enhancements to remove oscillations for highly non-uniform meshes. With respect to integral contact approaches, the CCS algorithm is less expensive, easier to code and can be added to a pre-existing analysis code with minimal effort. Numerical examples in both small and large deformations are investigated."}
