The Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN) is based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and periodic encoding. IPFN ensures scalability: the implicit formulation directly maps the input coordinates to features, which enables synthesis of arbitrary size.\n IPFN is shown to synthesize tileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. IPFN learns high-frequency functions that produce authentic, high-quality results. The network is constrained to model the inner statistics of the exemplar based on spatial latent codes in a periodic field."}
