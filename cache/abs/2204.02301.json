They propose a fully-coupled Lagrangian finite element framework which replicates the process of in-stent restenosis observed post stent implantation in a coronary artery. Qualitative validation of the computational model are presented by emulating a stented artery. Patient-specific data can be integrated into the model to predict the risk of restenosing and thereby assist in tuning of stent implants to mitigate the risk."}
