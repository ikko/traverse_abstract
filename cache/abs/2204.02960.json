A vision-and-language navigation agent trained with trajectories spatially-perturbed by the model improves success rate by up to 1.5% over a state of the art baseline on the R2R benchmark. The code will be made available to facilitate. generative data augmentation and applications to downstream robotics and embodied AI tasks, such as downstream robotics."}
