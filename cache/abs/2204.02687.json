They show 4.1% gain on AUPRC statistics compared to a single RNN prediction. They experiment with the newly proposed model on real-world EHRs data and the multivariate clinical event prediction task. With this way, the mixture of experts can provide flexible adaptation to the (limited) predictive power of the single base RNN model."}
