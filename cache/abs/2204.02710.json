These approaches are scalable, but fail to account for complex relationships that exist between context and response pairs. In this paper, they combine the best of both worlds by proposing a scalable model that can learn complex relationships. They train the models by optimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by context and responses in training data. They show that the resultant model achieves better performance as compared to other embedding-based approach on publicly available conversation data."}
