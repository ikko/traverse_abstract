They have achieved widespread success, having been inspired by the biological structure of the human brain. Activation functions are a crucial sub-component of neural networks. They define the output of a node in a network given a set of inputs. This survey discusses the main concepts of activation functions in neural networks, including; a brief introduction to deep neural networks and a summary of what are activation functions and how they are used. The most common properties, the different types of activation function, and some of the challenges, limitations, and alternative solutions."}
