Traditionally, potential functions or energy landscapes are designed by experts based on theoretical or heuristic knowledge. Here, they propose a new approach to leverage strongly typed parallel genetic programming (GP) for potential function discovery. They use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with NSGA-III selection to optimize individual age, fitness, and complexity through symbolic regression. With a DFT dataset of 863 unique carbon allotrope configurations drawn from 858 carbon structures, the generated potentials are able to predict total energies within $\\pm 7.70$ eV at low computational cost."}
