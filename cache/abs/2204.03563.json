In this paper, they introduce transfinite modal logic, combining modal and ordinal arithmetic. They argue that in practice, this logic can actually fit into a completely finite interpretation as well. It provides a perfect explanation for Sherlock Holmes' famous saying, \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\" They also prove a counterpart of finite model property theorem for the logic."}
