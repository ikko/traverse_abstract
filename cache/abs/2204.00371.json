As an alternative, the Robin-Numann scheme generalizes the fluid's boundary condition to a Robin condition by including the Cauchy stresses. This work proposes a strategy to merge these two ideas and benefit from their combined strengths. The effectiveness of this new quasi-Newton-accelerated Robin-neumann scheme was demonstrated for different FSI simulations."}
