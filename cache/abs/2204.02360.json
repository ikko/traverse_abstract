Data-driven decision making techniques have witnessed rapid evolution in the wind industry for such tasks during the last decade, from applying signal processing methods in early 2010 to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep learning in 2020. They hope that a systematic analysis of the past, present and future of CBM and. performance assessment can encourage more organisations to adopt data-driven."}
