It has three cascaded deep understanding modules designed to understand the accurate semantic meaning of words, the interactions between the input question and documents, and the supporting cues for the correct answer. They evaluate the model on two large scale benchmark datasets, namely TriviaQA Web and DuReader. Extensive experiments show that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets. They also demonstrate that the models achieve state-"}
