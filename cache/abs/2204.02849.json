Learning to adapt enables several new capabilities, such as fine-tuning models. Compared to baseline methods, the generations achieve state of the art results both in human evaluations and with perceptual scores when tested on a public multimodal dataset of natural images, as well as on a collected dataset of 400 million Stickers. They show how the diffusion-based model trains only, by leveraging a joint Text-Image multi-modal metric."}
