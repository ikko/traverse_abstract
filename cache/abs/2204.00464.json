With the introduction of Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are given the option to differentially allocate liquidity to be used for trades that occur within specific price intervals. With this in hand, they are able to compute optimal liquidity allocations for liquidity providers who hold beliefs over how prices evolve over time. Ultimately, they use this tool to shed light on the design question regarding how v3 contracts should partition price space for permissible liquidity allocations."}
