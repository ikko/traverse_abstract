Strong admissible sets and labellings can be used as an explanation of membership of the grounded extension. In the current paper, they present two algorithms for constructing relatively small strongly admissible labelling, with associated min-max numberings, for a particular argument. They believe that the algorithms can be of practical value in situations where the aim is to construct a minimal or near-minimal labelling in a time-efficient way."}
