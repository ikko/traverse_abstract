The method (TempAl) aligns temporally-close frames, revealing a general, slowly varying state of the environment. TempAl surpasses the instantaneous-only baseline in 35 environments out of 49. TempAl is based on contrastive loss, which pulls embeddings of nearby observations to each other while pushing away other samples from the batch. It can be interpreted as a metric that captures the temporal relations of observations."}
