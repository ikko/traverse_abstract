To do so, the AI must be able to recognize the goals and constraints of the human and have the means to help them. They present a novel formulation of the interaction between the AI and the human as a sequential game where agents are modelled using Bayesian best-response models.\n They identify novel trade-off for centaurs in partially observable tasks: for the AI's actions to be acceptable to the human, the machine must make sure their beliefs are sufficiently aligned, but aligning beliefs might be costly. They present a preliminary theoretical analysis of this trade-offs and its dependence on task structure."}
