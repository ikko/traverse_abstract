They focus on the setting where a planar system can travel at some range of speeds with unbounded acceleration. This setting can model many systems, such as fixed-wing drones.\n They show that by finding bounded-suboptimal solutions, one can dramatically reduce the number of time-optimal transitions used. They demonstrate using empirical evaluation that the planning framework can reduce the runtime by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while still providing guarantees on the quality of the solution."}
