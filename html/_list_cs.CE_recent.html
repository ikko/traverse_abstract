The core decisions in restoration planning are to partition the grid into a few sub-networks, each of which has an initial power source for black-start (called sectionalization problem) and then restart the generators and pick up the loads in each network (called generator startup sequencing problem or GSS) in a parallel fashion, aiming to restore electric service in shortest time.</p></a>

Then, contrarily to the traditional time series approach in which the most recent observations are taken as the calibration sample, they estimate autoregressive models only for data in these sub periods. They observe a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy compared to commonly used approaches, including the Autoregressive Hybrid Nearest Neighbors (ARHNN)</p></a>

Disorders of coronary arteries lead to severe health problems such as atherosclerosis, angina, heart attack and even death. The result is an IUQ methodology to calibrate a model with uncertain parameters and a microscale agent-based model of arterial tissue, which produces mechanical behavithe in line with the experimental data, according to the authors of the study.</p></a>

This renders the control and optimization of such systems a complex task due to their nonlinear behavithe. Standard methods such as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for many systems. For this reason, they propose a new deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a nonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear representation. They demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation accurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wider range of conditions than standard linearization.</p></a>

The current state-of-the-art approach, SIRZ-2, makes certain approximations that lead to inaccurate estimates for large atomic numbered (Z-e) materials. They show that the magnitude of performance improvement using SirZ-3 increases with increasing values for Z-E.</p></a>

They propose a fully-coupled Lagrangian finite element framework which replicates the process of in-stent restenosis observed post stent implantation in a coronary artery. Qualitative validation of the computational model are presented by emulating a stented artery. Patient-specific data can be integrated into the model to predict the risk of restenosing and thereby assist in tuning of stent implants to mitigate the risk.</p></a>

As an alternative, the Robin-Numann scheme generalizes the fluid's boundary condition to a Robin condition by including the Cauchy stresses. This work proposes a strategy to merge these two ideas and benefit from their combined strengths. The effectiveness of this new quasi-Newton-accelerated Robin-neumann scheme was demonstrated for different FSI simulations.</p></a>

They use performance models and numerical experiments to demonstrate that high-order methods greatly reduce the costs to reach engineering tolerances while enabling effective use of GPUs. They investigate accuracy, cost, and execution time on multi-node CPU and GPU systems for moderate to large models. They discuss efficient matrix-free representation of Jacobians and how automatic differentiation enables rapid development of nonlinear material models without impacting debuggability and workflows targeting GPUs.</p></a>

Traditionally, potential functions or energy landscapes are designed by experts based on theoretical or heuristic knowledge. Here, they propose a new approach to leverage strongly typed parallel genetic programming (GP) for potential function discovery. They use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with NSGA-III selection to optimize individual age, fitness, and complexity through symbolic regression. With a DFT dataset of 863 unique carbon allotrope configurations drawn from 858 carbon structures, the generated potentials are able to predict total energies within $\pm 7.70$ eV at low computational cost.</p></a>

It builds on the data-driven approach underlying the traditional construction of projections-based reduced-order models (PROMs) It is application-independent; is linearization-free; and therefore is robust for highly nonlinear problems.</p></a>

It combines a collocated formulation for the contact surfaces with a standard Galerkin treatment of the bulk. The CCS approach does not need enhancements to remove oscillations for highly non-uniform meshes. With respect to integral contact approaches, the CCS algorithm is less expensive, easier to code and can be added to a pre-existing analysis code with minimal effort. Numerical examples in both small and large deformations are investigated.</p></a>

Engineering applications for modeling, characterization, design, and control of such large-scale systems often rely on dimensionality reduction to make solutions computationally tractable in real-time. They propose a general framework called Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) that enables a mesh-agnostic, low-rank representation. NIF consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons: (i) ShapeNet, (ii) ParameterNet, which accounts for any other input complexity, including parametric dependencies, time, and sensor measurements.</p></a>

The general program sequence and examples of filling a unit cube, a parallelepiped, and a concave domain between two hemispherical surfaces, are presented. A sample application to the numerical modeling of bond formation between particles heated by a laser beam in powder bed 3D printing process is considered. The program sequence is presented.</p></a>

With the introduction of Uniswap v3, liquidity providers are given the option to differentially allocate liquidity to be used for trades that occur within specific price intervals. With this in hand, they are able to compute optimal liquidity allocations for liquidity providers who hold beliefs over how prices evolve over time. Ultimately, they use this tool to shed light on the design question regarding how v3 contracts should partition price space for permissible liquidity allocations.</p></a>
