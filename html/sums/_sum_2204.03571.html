<h3>Explicit and Implicit Pattern Relation Analysis for Discovering Actionable Negative Sequences</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.03571.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> An important but rarely explored problem is to analyze those nonoccurring (also called negative) yet important (NSP) sequences. The limited existing work on NSP mining relies on frequentist and downward closure property-based pattern-based patterns. This work makes the ﬁrst attempt for actionable NSP discovery. It builds an NSP graph.representation, quantify both explicit occurrence and implicit non-occurrence-based element and pattern relations, and then discover signiﬁcant, diverse and informative NSPs.<br/> An NSP is an impact-targeted negative sequential pattern with an impact label Infected. NSPs are usually more informative and useful than positivesequential patterns (PSPs) NSP mining can reveal non-occurring but important behaviors NSA and NSP discovery involve signiﬁcant theoretical and practical challenges. Addressing these issues not only requires new theories and tools but also new theories, tools but new theories. For example, an NSP could be: Attending a party without wearing masks and maintaining social distancing has a high probability of being infected by COVID-19. </p>

<p class="text"> Existing PSP mining methods and NSP NSP non-actionable, challenges cannot be directly addressed by existing PSP methods. They propose to dis-cover actionable NSPs that (1) are representative, highly probable and diverse to represent the whole original NSPcollection; (2) ﬁlter highly similar and redundant patterns for low computational complexity and high efﬁciency. SAPNSP appears to be the only one somehow relevant to representative NSPmining. It follows traditional frequentist-based NSA methods and pattern selection criteria.<br/> This work introduces non-co-occurrence-based implicitrelations between NSP itemsets in the DPP-based NSP graph. It captures rich element interactions and pattern-relations in NSPs, which are rarely explored in NSA and sequence analysis. The problem of represen-repetitive NSP discovery is converted to a probabilistic subset selection problem in a DPP graph. This method is even more effective in discovering implicitly coupled elements and patterns, being more informative and discovering even unexpected hidden knowledge. </p>
<p class="text"> SAPNSP does not consider implicit non-occurrence cou-plings between elements and between NSPs, and thus ﬁlters these lowly frequent but informative patterns. The approach suggests a comprehensive solution without the aforementioned shortcomings in discovering actionable NSP discovery. EINSP calculates both co-occurrences-based and non-co-occurring-based dependencies be-tween directly and indirectly linked itemsets in the whole NSP cohort. They capture much richer interactions than the ones modeled by the existing DPP-based methods.<br/> EINSP consists of fthe components: NSP graph con-struction, explicit relation modeling, implicit relation modeling, and overall relation-based NSP subgraph selection. P indicates that patients who undertake medical services a and c without a treatment b have a high probability of having disease status. p indicates a special treatment of a serious but low-chance disease, such as a rare cancer, where treatments are less likely to co-occur frequently. Such patterns may not be selected by existing NSA methods due to its relatively low frequency, even though p may be extremely useful for informing the disease treatment. </p>
<p class="text"> The NSP graph construction module transforms NSPs Y into a directed DDP-based graph G, which is a powerful and compressed representation of the NSP. The module EINSP calculates the overall probability of selecting an NSP subset Y by integrating both P k (Y) and P k(Y) in terms of co-occurrences with other NSP elements in the DPP-based NSP representations. In the following, they deﬁne2 the explicit element quality of each NSP element in the graph G.<br/> Given a path Yi in graph G corresponding to an NSP Yi in the pattern set Y, the implicit pattern quality qi(Yi) measures the quality of the path in G in terms of implicit relations between paths, i.e., the non-occurrence level between path Yi and other NSPs in the DPP graph. They deﬁne the explicit element diversity feature vector for each NSP element in G. The explicit element quality qe(yj.), yj., yni. </p>
<p class="text"> They use a log-linear model to decom-pose it, which depends on the explicit quality of each element and its element pair. NSP discovery is built on frequentist statistics, they define the NSP as an NSP sequence from a dataset from DSP. They use the model as a model that places a higher weight on NSP subsets that are composed of higher quality and more diverse NSP patterns. The model is based on the co-occurrence-based relationships between NSP elements and their formation into patterns.<br/> The diversity feature vector φe(Yi) of an NSP-like pattern Yi is decomposed additively over the elements yji. The k-th component is identiﬁed by the explicit normalized.element-wise mutual. mutual information (eNEMI) NEMI measures the ability to cap-ture both linear and non-linear dependencies between element.yjophobicyj.i and other NSP elements Ek. The explicit normalized element-wise. mutual.<br/> Ce is a symmetric and positive semideﬁnite matrix, where typically |E| ≪ |Y|. Ce is always much smaller in scale and less sensitive to a threshold than kernel Le. The representation Ce can be calculated by a second-order message-passing algorithm,. The non-zero eigenvalues of Ce and Le are identical. If vn is the n-th eigenvector of Ce then vn. is the. n-the-th. eigenvalue/eigen vector pairs (λn, vn)Nv of represen-re-repreen-repretation Ce, where </p>
<p class="text"> They formalize P k-DPP (Y) as follows as follows: P k.k,Nv (Y), P V e.J (Y ) (YJ) (Yj) is a subset of k patterns, inspired by the k-DPP pattern model. They measure the implicit relations between paths in the DPP-based NSP graph G in terms of their indirectly linked paths. In G, pattern Yi(Y) is highly implicitly signiﬁcant if the items in Yi are highly dependent on other NSP itemsets. This indicates the items are implicitly related if they are explicitly dependent (co-occurring)<br/> The implicit normalized element-wise mutual in-formerformation (iNEMI) between an item i and Z, i.e., iNEMi(i, Z), measures the implicit relations between items i and other non-co-occurring NSP itemsets Z. They deﬁne the implicit pattern quality of an NSP pattern Yi (Yi) and the maximum implicit relationship strength (IRS) of a path Yi corresponding to pattern Yi is calculated as follows: Gqi(yi) = ∅. Yi, the IRS of the corresponding itemsets transformed from Yi, is the largest IRS of these itemsets.<br/> The implicit diversity feature vector of pattern Yi is its normalized normalized feature vector φi(Yi) = Norm(di(Y) ) in the graph G. di(yi) is the set of all dependent itemsets. their related link itemsets. Di(YI) is a diversity feature of the pattern Yi in a graph. G. is a set of dependent itemets. Their related link itemets are their related itemets, such as R| </p>
<p class="text"> The k-DPP-based model of an NSP subset Y can be computed by a k-DPP model. The implicit dependency of a pattern Yi w.r.t.t., all potential link-likelihoods, measures the implicitsimilarity between Yi and Yj in the DPP graph. The overall probability P k(Y) is more affected by the major relations of patterns in subset Y. The NSP-SP algorithm selects a representative NSP subset based on its overall probability K(Eq. (7) and (13)<br/> Algorithm 1 summarizes the working mechanism and pro-proposal of the proposed EINSP method for actionable NSP-selection. EinSP is modeled as a mixture of element-wise P k(Y ) and calculates their probability in Eq. 15. The eigen-carrying eigenvectors are denoted as ˆV e and V i, with the mapping V e = BeT, BeT and Vi. The normalization of the vectors in V e, V i can be computed using only their preimages.<br/> Third, the implicit relation modeling in SectionIII-D measures the implicit pattern relations sensitive to the behavior of the pattern relations.

<p class="text"> The Pseudo-code of EINSP for Actionable NSP-Selection is a pseudo-code for the computational complexity of the baseline methods. SAPNSP applies e-NSP with complexityO(e) to generate the NSP set with pattern num-dominatedber |e − NSP| and then select its subset with complexity. It then calculates the implicit probability of the subset Y in Eq. (13) sensitive to items I and k-size subsets with complexity O(|I|k)<br/> The empirical analysis of the proposed EINSP in com-parison with fthe baselines is undertaken on six real-life datasets and 17 synthetic datasets. They adopt the following six real life datasets: a UCI dataset with 989,818 anony-oglemously ordered webpage visits to MSNBC.com. A FIFA World Cup’98 dataset5 with 20,450 clickstream sequences, 2,990 distinct items, and an average of 34.74 items per sequence with a standard deviation of 24.08 items. </p>
<p class="text"> Table I describes datasets in terms of six data factors. The base-based data factors are C10 T6 S8 I8 DB10k N0.1k, which is further expanded to others by adjusting one factor (in boldface) once. Baseline methods are evaluated against the baselines on real-life and synthetic datasets. The algorithms are implemented in Python, and exper-orativeiments are conducted on a cluster running node with IntelXeon W3690 (6 Core) CPU of 3.47GHz.<br/> Negative-GSP (GSP) contains one parameter min sup as a frequency constraint on the frequent co-occurrences of items in patterns. In Sections V-B, V-C and V-D, they tailor min sup for the six real-life datasets and 30% for all synthetic datasets. The sequence coverage of subset S in dataset D is denoted as SC(S|D), which is the ratio of the data sequences in D that cover at least one pattern with respect to the size of the dataset. </p>
<p class="text"> Synthetic Sequence Datasets w.r.t.w. Synthetic Sequaries w.yrs.rs.w.: Synthetic sequences are synthetic sequaries. Synthetic sequaries are synthetic sequences that can be synthesised into a form of sequence sequences. The sequence sequence is based on a single sequence sequence that has been sequenced in the wild for more than 30 years.

Of all the methods, Top-k selection performs the worst as it assumes that the covered sets are completely neglects the diversity of the selected subset. A higher item coverage indicates more informative and diverse items covered in the subset selected from the entire entire NSP. The methods are deﬁned as the methods and the methods of disjoint and joint andjoint datasets are inapplicable for real-life cases.<br/> The k-means method selects patterns from each cluster of the NSP collection and guarantees that the covered set of selected patterns shares a much smaller overlap between clusters. SAPNSP achieves a slightly better sequence coverage than Top-k selection. Top-K selection achieves a relatively lower sequence coverage on datasets with a smaller average length, such as DS1 and DS4, since a larger proportion of data sequences covers multiple NSPs with relatively rare entities. The kMeans method is not able to model the quality and diversity of each NSP pattern. </p>
<p class="text"> EINSP and k-SDPP signiﬁcantly outperform all the other baselines on six datasets in terms of sequence coverage. The performance improvement made by EinSP on datasets DS1-DS3 and DS6 is less signi.cant. When k increases to 150, the improvement on these datasets increases to a maximum of 64.4% and 63.1% and an average of 46.1%, respectively. The results show the NSP captures the co-occurrence-based element/pattern couplings in NSPs. This is the effective design of modeling explicit element and pattern couplings.<br/> The method EINSP and its simpliﬁed version k-SDPP achieve better performance in terms of pattern.coverage and diversity. The results show that both Top-k selection and.egegSAPNSP achieve the worst item coverage on all datasets. This is because they always tend to.select short-size patterns consisting of only high-frequency. items but ignore those rarely observed items. Average Item Frequency on Datasets DS1 to DS6 (k = 150) </p>
<p class="text"> Top-k selection and SAPNSP tend to select patterns combining a smaller number of high-frequency items due to their reliance on the frequency and downward closure property-based NSP selection criteria. This results in the high item frequency of the items covered by the NSP subsets selected by these methods. EINSP produces more balanced, diversiﬁed and novel NSP items and patterns from the entire dataset. The average pattern size of selected subsets measures the selected NSP subset quality.<br/> Average Pattern Size Comparison on DS1 to DS6 is shorter than that of k-SDPP and EINSP. The k-means method achieves a bigger average-average-size size than the aforementioned two methods. K-Means method only selects the most frequent patterns in a cluster, which are the shortest in-separate-sized patterns in each belonging cluster. EinSP achieves a smaller average pattern size because it uses implicit pattern-relatedquality to select NSPs. </p>
<p class="text"> The average implicit pattern relation strength measures the average implicit quality of the subset selected by an NSP miner. The three baselines Top-k selection, SAPNSP and k-SDPP achieve similar but low average implicit patterns strength. In contrast, EINSP achieves a much higher average implicitpattern relation strength on datasets DS3, DS5, DS6 and DS7. This demonstrates the importance of modelling implicit quality and the diversity of non-co-occurring NSP elements.<br/> Both k-SDPP and EINSP achieve better performance for a larger-subset size k in terms of the average implicit pattern relation strength of its selected NSP subsets than all of the baselines. Table III shows the sensitivity test on size k = 150, where the adopted synthetic datasets are extended from the base dataset by tuning one boldface factor at a time. By increasing factor C, more long-sized sequences are generated, more frequent elements are generated. By decreasing factor DB, the growth of factor DB has a limited impact on all methods because it does not change the distribution of a dataset. </p>

The most important factors are that the study is the ability to predict the outcomes of a given given a number of events such as health and safety risk factors. The study was conducted with data from the National Statistical Statistical Statistical Center of Excellence (NSPNSPC) and the National Institute of Health and Human Services (NSSPN) and NSPPNSPPPP)<br/> The non-occurrence nature of negative sequences hide their potential for applications. NSA and NSP mining is much more chal-glyginging than PSA mining, which has been widely explored in areas such as genomic analysis and pattern mining. EINSP opens a new direction by analyzing both explicit and implicit pattern relations and element relations, which can be applied to PSA and PSP mining More theoretical studies are required to explore comprehensive explicit or implicit element/pattern/pattern relations. </p>
