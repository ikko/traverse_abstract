<h3>Walk this Way! Entity Walks and Property Walks for RDF2vec</h3>
<img src="abstract.png">
<p class="text"> RDF2vec is an approach for embedding entities of a knowledge graph in a continuous vector space. It extracts sequences of entities from knowledge graphs, then feeds those into the word embedding algorithm word2vec. In this poster, they introduce two new approaches to walk extraction: e-walks and p walks. These strategies put an emphasis on the structure or the neighborhood of an entity respec-ively, and thereby allow for creating embeddings which focus on simi-centricity or relatedness. </p>

<p class="text"> They present two new variants of RDF2vec: p-RDF2vevec empha-phthalsizes structural properties of entities, i.e. their attributes, and consequently has a.higher exposure towards similarity. e-Rdf2vec emphasizes the neighboring enti-ties of entities and has a higher exposure towards relatedness. They hypothesize that embeddings computed from p-walks capture (structural) similarity, while those computed from e-Walks capture contextual similarity, which can also be understood as relatedness. </p>
