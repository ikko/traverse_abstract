<p class="text"> Recent advances in Natural Language Processing is opening up new perspectives on the construction of conversational informa-centric seeking (CIS) systems. Leveraging pre-trained language models for.conversational information seeking from text is a task far from being resolved. The results highlight the usefulness of the in-context learning customizations, which can substantially contribute to address the “training data challenge” of deep learning based NLP techniques the BPM. The study was published in the journal Xiv:2204.03542v1. </p>

<p class="text"> They explore the feasibility of using in-context learning over the pre-trained language models to perform process extraction from textual documents in an incremental question and answering manner. The paper is structured as follows. They provide some background on process information extraction from text and incontext learning (Section 2), then they describe the approach and its empirical investigation using annotated texts from the PET dataset. They also exploit the conversational nature of the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) model, and two customizations built by providing conceptual deﬁnitions of business process elements. </p>
<p class="text"> In-context learning relying on the provision of instructions, some contextual knowl-glyedge2, few examples, and the actual task to be solved that are coded into a single language template called prompt. This approach has been shown to be extremely useful to address the training data challenge and have been used to address topics ranging from medical dialogue summarization to hate speech detection Bellan et al. published a paper on how to overcome the lack of training data in process (information) extraction. </p>
<p class="text"> PET provides annotated annotations of text with a number of process entities, and their relations. PET also comes with extensive annotation guidelines that aim at levelling out diﬀer-centric annotation styles of people. PETannotates within the control ﬁed “ﬂow” relation, implicitly sub-sumed by the annotations, that is obtained by. directly connecting the appropriate activities with appropriate activities, and removing the extra control. elements that they do not consider. The “activity” label is used in PET only to represent the verbal component of what is usually. usually called business process activity. </p>
<p class="text"> Bellan et al. discuss how to build conversational models that act as conversational systems. The questions used to extract information from text are reported in Figure 3. They aim at building a structured representation such as the one represented in Figure 4. The questions, and therefore construction, are posed in an incremental manner. The approach mimics the way they manually build conceptual models (e.g., by interviewing domain experts with follow up questions) and because it enables the construction of ﬂexible pipelines by combining diﬀerent incremental questions. </p>
<p class="text"> Using pre-trained language models for CIS from text from text and in-context learning customizations. The deﬁnitions of Activity, Participant, Process Model, Flow and Sequence Flow are reworded to reflect the context of Business Process Management and process modelling. The results are presented in the form of a few prompts that contain relevant contextual knowledge, and a few shots (a.k.a.a.) of the task to solve 6.7 with the help of a preamble identifying the BPM context, plus ﬁve de-amble. </p>
<p class="text"> They would like to investigate the capability of pre-trained language models and in-context learning to extract diﬀerent process elements from text. The approach described in Section 3 has been empirically evaluated by performing a ne-grained analysis on seven documents extracted from the PET dataset. The characteristics of the documents they did use as samples were documents 2.2 and 10.9 taken from the reference dataset provided by Friedrich in, while the answers were obtained using the PET annotated dataset. </p>
<p class="text"> The aim was to inject domain-speciﬁc conceptual knowledge into the pre-trained language model to observe the capability of the system to exploit the basic domain knowledge. Table 2 provides the results of the empirical assessment performed on the portion of the PET dataset used for investigating the proposed approach. In few cases the model was able to provide semantically correct answers which did not match PET labels. A paradigmatic case is the answer “check and repair the computer” as a single activity, instead of the two separate ones which are reported PET, as required by its report. </p>
<p class="text"> Follows (ex) measures the ability of the system to extract the. relation on the basis of the activities extracted by Q1, thus measuring the eﬀective quality of the incremental Q/A interaction. Performs (gs) measure the ability the system on extracting the relation (similarly for performs) In-context learning approaches that rely on con-glyglytextual BPM knowledge and few examples more e-ective in providing answers than the GPT-3 model, and can lead to good results. </p>
<p class="text"> Using pre-trained language models for CIS from text11.2Shots, they use language models to test language models. The models are based on the language of the language used to test the reliability and accuracy of these models. They use the language language model to test the ability to identify language patterns in text 11.2.3 and 11.4. The results show that language models can be used in the context of a language model.

<p class="text"> The model (independently by the adopted setting described in subsection 4.2) is not able to provide proper answers to generic and complex questions. The model creativity is set by two parameters that set the sampling strategy: temperature and time. The more the creativity value is increases, the more similarity between generated textual outputs by starting from the same question but requested at diﬀerent timestamps. Creativity could help with complex reasoning tasks, but the more the model creativity value increases the way with which the textual output is generated, may have relevant detrimental e-ects. </p>
<p class="text"> In order to preserve the capability of acting in an eﬀective way within the business-process domain, they adopted the pre-trained language model before queries related to the extraction of the extractions of text. The outcomes of the performed empirical assessment demonstrated the.urable suitability of the proposed approach that has the potential of becoming a groundbreaking. for the expert-supervised incremental building of business process models. The performance obtained by the pro-posed approach highlight how in-context learning techniques may be used side-by-side with human experts within annotation campaigns. </p>
<p class="text"> The generality of this approach is hampered by the restriction of the input to heavily-structured Process Deﬁnition Documents. The second stream contains works that address process extraction from text as a two-steps transformation approach with intermediate representation. The third stream of work instead tackles only the function of the two-step transformation approach, thus extracting information as lists of tags from a text. The recent work of proposes a hierarchical neural network approach to tackle the problem of classifying sentences in procedural sentences without engineering any features. </p>
