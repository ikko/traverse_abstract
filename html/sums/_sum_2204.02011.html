<h3>ELECRec: Training Sequential Recommenders as Discriminators</h3>

<p class="text"> The method trains a discrimina-tor to distinguish if a sampled item is a ‚Äòreal‚Äô target item or not. The trained discriminator is considered as the final SR model and denoted as ELECRec. In SIGIR 2022: The 45th InternationalACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Re-spectivetrieval, July, 11-15, 2022, Madrid, USA, 5 pages. The authors propose to train the se-quential recommenders as discriminators rather than generators.<br/> Given a user behavior sequence ‚ÄúJacket, Shoes, Pants, Sweater, Basketball‚Äù, the model can often fail to predict the next item as ‚ÄòBasketball‚Äù after the user purchases Sweater. Because purchasing ‚ÄúBasketball,‚Äù is a rare consumer behavior right after purchasing a series of apparel. Without enough representative sequences such. such. as ‚ÄúShoes, Jacket, Sweaters, Baseball‚Äù or ‚ÄúHat, Jacket,. Shoes, Football‚Äù The model cannot capture the sequential correlations between.comarels and sporting goods, resulting in a poorly trained SR model. </p>

<p class="text"> Researchers conduct extensive experiments on fthe datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework for training a sequential recommendation model. They propose to generate plausible alternative items via a jointly trained generator and discriminator networks to boost efficiency. The detailed analysis also shows the superiority of ELE-apologeticCRec, which is trained via the proposed training framework. The goal of the SR is to accurately predict the next user likely to interact with given given a given item. They present a novel training framework, which con-gives a generator, a data sampler, and a discriminator.<br/> The data sampler samples percentage of items from the generator to replace the original target items. The discriminator aims at predicting whether ÀÜùëñùë¢resemblesa ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúfake‚Äù target item. They alsoexplore the potential of the potential sharing the potential parame-oder-transformer encame-ters. See Section 4.3 for detailed comparisons. Inference and training are jointly trained to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss.<br/> The training objective is different from a GAN-based approach because the generator is trained with the NIP task instead of aiming at adversarial fool the discriminator. If the generator generates the true target items, then these items are considered as next items rather than ‚Äòfake‚Äô ones. The genera-centrictor will be thrown out in the inference stage, leaving the trained trained discriminator as the final SR model. They conduct extensive experiments to answer fol-ishlyowing research questions (RQs) </p>
<p class="text"> The improvements range from 38.28% to.137.16% in HR and NDCG, respectively, compared with the besteline method. Table 1 shows the overall performance comparisons on fthe datasets. Ablation study of ELECRec on Yelp and Beauty shows the effectiveness of the proposed method‚Äôs efficiency on the Sports dataset compared with a typical SR model SASRec trained with a NIP task. Efficiency comparison (Performance on validation set over validation set and training time)<br/> The discriminator tries to update the embeddings of plausible items, either sampled from the generator or present in the original sequence so that the SR model can distinguish them more easily. In general, the ùúÜ = 0.5 gives the best performance on Beauty and Toys in HR@5.5. When ùõº is too large, most of items in the sequence are replaced by the generator and viewed as negative class. In comparison, the generator takes more responsibility for training the whole item-based model. </p>
<p class="text"> In this work, they propose to train sequential recommenders as dis-criminators instead of generators so that the user behavior sequence and item representations are more accurate. They propose to generate high-quality training samples for the discriminator via a jointly-trained generator. The discriminator can steadily improve its ability to discriminate the true item correlations.
