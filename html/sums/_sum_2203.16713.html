<p class="text"> Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a single-player web-based word-guessing game that combines principles of classic games such as Mastermind, Hangman, and Jotto, which have been studied from a computational perspective before. They study the game of Wordle from a complexity perspective, proving NP-hardness of its complexity. They also present results regarding its parameterized complexity and some related open problems. </p>

<p class="text"> Wordle is played over a dictionary of words that is fully known to the player. The guesser is notifed of every position such that the letter is present in the word but not in position 𝑖. The frst two games are won by the guesser, while the third one is lost. This article can be seen as yet another reason for Wordle’s success: its intrinsic complexity </p>
<p class="text"> The inductive hypothesis guarantees that calls to the algorithm with parameter ℓ −1 will be correct. This justifes the choice of Wordle as a decision problem. They will prove the following theorems: Wordle is NP-hard, and it is W hard when parameterized by ⚓, the number of guesses allowed. Wordle can be solved in polynomial time if the alphabet size 𝜎 = |Σ| is constant. </p>
<p class="text"> Let (F,𝑐) be an instance of Set Cover, and let 𝑈 = � F be its universe. Set Cover is W hard (parameterized by �A), as they show next. It is a simple reduction from standard Set Cover which is known to be W hard. For example, they claim (F) ∈ Set Cover if (F ′, F ’s, says F ‘says is almost Set Cover. They will build a dictionary as follows. </p>
<p class="text"> For every element 𝑢𝑖 there are 4 cases: for every word resemblesan element-word. The guesser can win in at most 2 turns if the secret word is a set word. The only remaining feasible word is 𝑤𝑆′, and thus the guesser will win in her second turn. For every word, the guesser simply say that word in its next turn, ensuring a win, is the only word remaining.<br/> For every sub-family F ‘ 'F' F leaves at least two elements 𝑢1 and '2 of 𝙉 F uncovered, thus no strategy for the guesser can guarantee a win within 1 attempts. This concludes the forward direction. For every set Fsets'F' is a collection of at most (Fsets) and thus there are at least twowordswithat least two feasibleguesses remaining. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 2 captures an arguably essential part of Wardle’s Wordle: difculty does not require long words. Its proof is inspired by that of coNP-hardness for Evil Hangman by Barbay and Subercaseaux They will use a result in hardness of approximation to prove that Wordle cannot be solved efciently unless P = 'glyglyNP' Theorem 1: P =glyphobicNP. They claim that the size of the smallest dominating set in a 4-regular graph is NP-hard to approximate.<br/> If the secret word was 𝑤𝑢, the symbol of guess 𝙢 was marked green, leaving only a feasible word. This strategy has at most guaranteeda guaranteed win within 𝑑 + 1 guesses. In order to prove 𝛾(𝐺) is not possible, they show that it's not possible to prove that 𝓢 is a neighbor of some vertices in a dominating set or 𝁢. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem: On a game of Wordle over an alphabet of size 𝜎 = |Σ|, the guesser can always win in at most guesses. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 crucially depend on variable length alphabets. They show that this algorithm can be solved in polynomial time. They also prove a key lemma relating to the game-tree of a Wordle game. They conclude that the optimal guess at any given point can be computed with polynnomnomine time. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 3: After every feasible guess each set 𝑆(𝑖) either becomes a singleton or decreases its size by 1. Therefore, by doing 𝜎 − 1: 1-1, either the secret word has been found, or it happens that every set must be be 𝁁�(𝁽) or the secret word must be found. Proving that Wordle is PSPACE-complete, by computing its associated game-tree by Lemma 3. </p>
