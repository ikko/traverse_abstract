<h3>Korean Online Hate Speech Dataset for Multilabel Classification: How Can Social Science Aid Developing Better Hate Speech Dataset?</h3>
<h3>Korean Online Hate Speech Dataset for Multilabel Classification: How Can Social Science Aid Developing Better Hate Speech Dataset?</h3>
<img src="abstract.png">
<p class="text"> Researchers suggest a multilabel Korean online hate speech dataset that covers seven categories of hate speech. The 35K dataset includes 24K online comments with Krippendorff's Alpha Alpha label accordance of.713. The base model with 24K initial dataset.achieved the accuracy of LRAP.892, but improved to.919 after being combined with 11K additional data. The largest multilingual hate speech da-genre-taset is designed by Vidgen and Derczynski (2020)<br/> A single sentence can aim at multiple targets of hatred, and the cultural and local contexts are required to discriminate the un-profound intention of utterance. Badjatiya et al. (2017) and Kennedy III et al. labeled the dataset only with binary Categories (1=hate speech / 0=general sentences) Badjatisya et.Kennedy and Hovy (2016) dealt with the terms racist and sexist, and Warner and Hirschberg (2012) showed more detailed cate-oglegories: anti-semitic,. anti-black, anti-Asian, Asian, anti-woman, Anti-muslim </p>

<p class="text"> Based on real-world online comments, they attempt to de-velop a multi-label Korean hate speech. Hate speech is defined as an aggressive expression against minorities and can appear in various topics such as genders, ethnic groups, religions, etc. Each culture has its own different interpretations and different interpretations in determining hate speech. For example, hate speech based on ethnicities such as race, skin color, and skin color were mainly expressed in Germany, Canada, and Denmark. Japan, on the other hand, its hate speech appears to promote discriminatory awareness against foreigners while Korea presents despise of weak minority <br/> Previous research includes finding vocabulary that refers to hate expressions (Bunde, 2021) or discovering the malice grotesque of text from online spaces including social media. Some are concerned about simply determining whether a single sentence is a hate ex-ipientpression or not. The binary classified dataset (1=hate expression, 0=general sentence) is dominant (Badjatiya et al., 2017; Kennedy III et al, 2017), and data that provide multiple categories such as misogyny, misogyny, and anti-Semitism are still restricted to western culture. </p>
<p class="text"> racial hate speech in South Korea has a unique and distin-guished aspect since it is more likely to be concentrated on ethnic groups such as Korean-Chinese (also known as Chosunjok) and even North Korean refugees. South Koreans also have implicit preferences toward each racial group, leading to expressing their antagonism toward specific racial groups. Unlike Western countries, religious hate speech is mainly targeted at Protestants, not a religiously persecuted minority group. Hate speech toward Protestants varies from “Kae-dokkyo ipient(Doglike Protestants) to hate speech for specific sect or pastors.<br/> Islam is tended to be regarded as a negative word it-ishly itself. Islam is sometimes used to disparage cer-ipienttain political party supporters in South Korea. Hate speech targets two specific regions: Jeolla-province, Gyeongsang and G.Yongong Province. Racism is particularly noteworthy about the latest regional hate speech in Korea is the racist sentiment which is distinct from traditional political conflicts. With the slowdown of economic growth of Korea and the growing influx of foreign workers, racist hatred of Southeast Asia and China emerged. </p>
<p class="text"> Hate speech against a specific generation can be expressed as ageism. Ageism is defined as “prejudice by one age group ipienttoward other age groups” (Butler, 1969) Ageism may intensify in countries such as Korea because of rapid development and aging because differences in values and values can be-tween generations. In addition, hate speech for older people occurs because they deprive the younger generation of opportuni-i-repaireties and becomes a social burden.<br/> Previous literature suggests Eastern cultures are less ageist than Western cultures. Eastern cultures emphasize high esteem for older people. However, recent studies tell that it is important to consider the normative context and personal attitudes rather than supporting stereotypes. It is imperative to develop a dataset implementing sociolog-centric perspectives when identifying gender discrimination online because gender refers to a social category represented with femininity and masculinity (not based on a biological.difference) Since gender is a social concept, what it means to be feminine and masculine has changed over time. </p>
<p class="text"> In Korea, misogyny–discrimination and oppression of women– takes place because of precarity between feminin-centricity and masculinity and is often subtle and invisible. There have been moves to return to an androcentric and patriarchy society on online communities like Kimchi-nyeo on Facebook, referring to Korean women in a derogatory manner, and Il-be. Discrimination against non-normative families in Korea is overt and explicit because of its strong emphasis on heteronormative marriage, pregnancy, and childbirth.<br/> The online space of south Korea has been male-dominated space where miso-ophobicgynistic speech was prevalent. However, the new generation of women embarked on a mas sive strike back. The fierce cyber warfare against male users who still insist on sexist values with mis-ogynistic attitudes has radicalized them. It is controversial whether using male-hating expressions can be considered as hate speech. The key argument is that hostile remarks against males cannot be conceptually equivalent to misogyny. </p>
<p class="text"> A total of 24K online comments were collected from 24K comments collected from major web portals’ news section (Naver and Daum) and community websites (DCInside, Ilbe, Womad, and Today Humor) in South Korea. The authors of this paper, all of whom have master's degree or higher in social science, used the term 'jegi' as a slang to ridicule concepts such as ‘death’ and ‘fall’ The authors only judge the following sentences as malicious comments, instead of hate speech.<br/> They trained three kinds of multilabel classifiers: KcBERT---large (Korea Hate Speech Dataset) and KcELECTRA-base (Lee, 2020) models. The labels achieved Krippendorff's Alpha of.713. With seven hate speech categories, one general profanity category, extra hate speech, and the last ordinary harmless -text, the label accordance among these 10 multi-label data achieved. The findings show the state of the art on NSMC (Naver sentiment movie corpus) and Korean Hate Speech. </p>
<p class="text"> They adopt the label ranking average precision (LRAP) as a primary metric for the model when learning the data with a 3:1 train-test ratio. LRAP is the average over each ground ipienttruth label assigned to each sample. KcBERT-large model achieved the highest LRAP score, suggesting the larger size of the model leads to better performance. The performance of adding neutral documents and hu-man-in-the-loop data to the model is stated in Table 2.<br/> The paper conducts a theoretical discussion on the con-geycept and categories of hate speech based on social science theories. They suggested a multilabel Korean online hate speech da--e-taset that covers various terms surrounding social minorities. Table 3 : Example Sentences are summarized in Table 3. Hate speech dataset consists of 24K online comments with Alpha label accordance of.713, 2.2K neutral sentences from Wikipedia, 1.7K labeled sen-referred sentences generated by the Human-in-the-Loop procedure, and 7.1K neutral. </p>
<p class="text"> 24K initial dataset achieved the accuracy of LRAP.892, but improved to.919 after adding 11K additional data. This paper could be used as a manual for building a more generalized hate speech dataset with diverse cultural backgrounds based on social science perspectives. The study was financially supported by Smilegate AI center of Smilegate Entertainment. Without these experts in social science, they wouldn’t be able to build a high-quality hate speech dataset<br/> Researchers from Sogang Univer-University-Sogang University and Yonsei University in South Korea share their findings. The authors have published their findings in the form of an article entitled "glyglyglyphic" and "appendic" The authors' findings are published at the University of South Korea, Seoul University-University of Korea and the National University of Singapore, respectively, in Seoul, Singapore, Singapore and the United States. The authors are invited to submit their findings to the University-Univers of Korea, South Korea and South Korea.<br/> The list includes, apologeticand grophobiccompanies.
