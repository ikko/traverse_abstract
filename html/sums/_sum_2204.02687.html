<h3>Learning to Adapt Clinical Sequences with Residual Mixture of Experts</h3>
<h3>Learning to Adapt Clinical Sequences with Residual Mixture of Experts</h3>

<p class="text"> Clinical event sequences in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) record detailed information about the patient condition and patient care as they occur in time. They show 4.1% gain on AUPRC statistics compared to a single RNN prediction. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture consists of multiple (expert) RNN models covering patient sub-populations. With this way, they augment MoE based on the prediction signal from a pretrained base GRU model. </p>

<p class="text"> The goal of this paper is to study ways of enhancing the one-ﬁts-all RNNmodel solution with additional RNN models. They study this solution in the context of multivariate event prediction problem where the goal is to predict, as accurately, the future occurrence of a wide range of events recorded in EHRs. The experiments with R-MoE model show 4.1% gain on AUPRC compared to a single GRU-based prediction. For the reproducibility, the code, trained models, and data processing scripts are available on this link:https://github.com/leej35/residual-moe2 </p>
<p class="text"> J.J. Lee and M. Hauskrecht: They address the heterogeneity issue of the neural sequence model by specializing it with a novel learning mechanism based on Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) architecture. The dynamics of heterogeneous patient state sequences can be modeled through a number of experts; each consists of GRU which is capable of modeling non-linearities and temporal dependencies. With this way, MoE can learn to adapt to adapt the residual of the model. </p>
<p class="text"> The proposed model R-MoE consists of δbase module and Mixture-of-Experts module. Each expert consists of GRU with its hidden state dimension d′, output projection matrix W i.o and a bias vector bi.o. The output omoe of the MoE module can be written as follows:. The model provides ﬂexible adaptation to the (limited) predictive power of the base-GRU model. They evaluate the performance of the model on the real-world data in MIMIC-3 Database </p>
<p class="text"> They segment all patient event time-series with a time-window W=24 with a sliding-window method. For physiological events, they select 16 important event types with the help of a critical care physician. Lab test results and physi-ological measurements with continuous values are discretized to high, normal, and low values based on normal ranges compiled by clinical experts. They compare R-MoE with multiple baseline models that are able to predict events given their previous history. The baselines are: Base GRU model (GRU), Logistic regression based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) </p>
<p class="text"> They use embedding dimension ϵ=64, hidden state dimen-sion d=512 for base GRU model and RETAIN. Hidden states dimension d′ for each GRU in R-MoE is determined by the internal cross-validation set (range: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512) The number of experts is also determined by a set of experts. They stop training when the internal validation set’s loss does not improve during the last K epochs (K=5) </p>
<p class="text"> Event-type-speciﬁc AUPRC performance gain of R-MoE compared to base GRU model (δbase) and occurrence ratio. Occurrence ratio is how much times each event had occurred among all segmented time-windows across all test set patient data. With more experts, the performance is slowly increasing, but it slightly decreases after 50.0%. Prediction performance of the R--Pean MoE on diﬀerent hidden states dimensions of the model is ﬁxed at 64. </p>
