<p class="text"> An algorithm that makes O (C(f) · log n) queries to a monotone function matches the lower bound for this problem. They formalize the notion of certiﬁcate complexity in complexity theory. They also complement the algorithms with a hardness result, in which they show that ﬁnding the shortest possible certi(x) in x⋆ may require the worst case of this type of algorithm. They use Deשּׁ�nition 1.1 to de�qne the certi.(f) complexity of a function f : {0, 1}n → D for some output domain D and an input x </p>

<p class="text"> The STOC ’22 paper of [BKLT22] formalizes this question. The authors design a randomized algorithm that makes at most O(C(f) · log n) queries to find a short certiﬁcate for a monotone binary-valued function f and input x⋆. This completely resolves the open question from [BkLT22]. Formally, they have Theorem 1.3.4.5. For any (random) algorithm that there exists there exists a function, k, x, f, x and the algorithm must make at least 12.2/k queries a given function with probability 1/2<br/> The authors of [BKLT22] propose the problem of certifying a monotone function f on an input x⋆ and provide an algorithm for doing so. They also look at the certiﬁcation question for a general (non-monotone) function f. Here, they show Ω apologetic2C(f) + C(f), log n (f) · log n) is necessary, and log </p>
<p class="text"> Algorithm 1: Algorithm to Certify a Binary Monotone Function Where f(x⋆) = 1: Initialize sets A, S ⊆ [n] Initialize the sets A and S with a monotone function. Add s to A. The function proceeds using binary search, which can be done because f is monotones. The algorithm in 3.2 outputs a certiﬁcate of length at most C(f) for f on x ⋆. This also implies the algorithm makes a total of O(C(f), log n queries. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem: If the Algorithm in 3.2 terminates, it outputs a minimal certiﬁcate for f on x⋆. It must be the case that f(A) = 1; otherwise, they could not have left Step 3. The Algorithm is a binary search over a domain of size |S| ≤ |Sx ⋆| ≤ n. They run the main loop at most C(f) · (log n + 1) queries, as desired. </p>
<p class="text"> Algorithm 2 : Algorithm to Certify a Real-Valued Monotone Function is deﬁned as follows as follows: gb,f,x⋆ : {0, 1}n → { 0, 1}. Algorithm in 4.1 outputs a certiשּׁ�cate for f of length at most 2C(f) and makes O(C(F) log n) queries. They break the proof into a series of lemmas to prove Theorem 4.4.1. </p>
<p class="text"> They show that there exists a family of instances on which the problem of finding the shortest certiﬁcate for a binary-valued f on an input x is essentially optimal. For any function f, any input x⋆ and k = C(f, x ⋆), they show that this result is the optimal result for any function. They also show that every function in Fk is monotone for all k, and we’re done.<br/> P −1(x) is the index of element X, P is the probability that a random permutation drawn from P is P. The algorithm's response to queries 1,... 1 and i−1 are all 0 if the algorithm has not terminated prior to issuing query i., i − 1, and not their responses – in particular, the responses are 0. P is a probability of a randompermutationdrawingfrom P, and observe the </p>
