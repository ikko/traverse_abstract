<p class="text"> tmVar 3.0: an improved variant concept recognition grotesqueand normalization tool. It is able to recognize a wide spectrum of variant related entities (e.g., allele and copy number) and to group different variant mentions belonging to the same concept in an article for improved accuracy. It also provides additional variant normalization options such as allele-specific identifiers from the ClinGen Allele Registry. It exhibits a state-of-the-art performance with over 90% accuracy in F-measure in recognition and normalization. </p>

<p class="text"> The improved tmVar 3.0 system achieves consistent high precision and recall on several publicly available gold standard corporpora and is freely available for the scientific community. They first expanded the recognition scope to cover multiple variant related concepts which were rarely discussed in previous studies. For instance, in PMID: 20577006, they group the variants (i.e., P799L and P799) belonging to rs121912637. In this article, P799 co-occurs with disease metatropic dysplasia in the same sentence, but not P799 L. In this case, grouping the two variant mentions makes it easier to link P799 </p>
