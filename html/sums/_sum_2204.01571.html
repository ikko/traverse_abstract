<h3>Coarse-to-Fine Q-attention with Learned Path Ranking</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.01571.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> Learned Path Ranking (LPR) is a method that learns to rank a set of goal-reaching paths. LPR is added as an extension to C2F-ARM+LPR, which adds a larger set of tasks to the system. The new system retains the sample ef-sample efﬁciency of its predecessor, while also being able to achieve a larger task.<br/> The search is ongoing for a general manipulation algorithm that operates on visual inputs and sparse rewards. They also learn real-world tasks, tabula rasa, in 10-15 minutes, with only 3 demonstrations. The Coarse-to-ﬁne Attention-driven Robot Manipulation(C2F-ARM) system learns to output next-best poses to bring the robot to the predicted pose.<br/> Using motion planning means that the agent is unable to learn to output very speciﬁc motions that may be needed for a task. C2F-ARM assumes no prior knowledge of objects in the scene. This higher-level action space makes for highly-ef ﬁcient learning in the real world.<br/> C2F-ARM+LPR is an extension to C2ARM that learns to rank a set of paths. This allows for a larger set of tasks to be learned, such as lifting a toilet seat. This is in contrast to the previous version of C2armarm, which uses pathplanning to generate a single path.<br/> In addition to this, they also learn a behaviorcloning policy that is only trained on paths (from path planningand curves sampling) that eventually lead to successfully completing the task. This has the effect of capturing the process and learning a behavior that is consistent with successful cloning. </p>

<p class="text"> C2F-ARM+LPR is a Q-function that learns to rank paths generated from different sources, including path planners, Bézier curve sampling, or even a learned path policy. They benchmark the method on 16 sim-ulated RLBench tasks (Figure 2)<br/> C2F-ARM is an algorithm that discretizes the action space in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner for learning via a Q-attention network. The predecessor, ARM, has recently been extended to a Binghampolicy parameterization to improve training stability.<br/> Path planner function learns to rank a set of paths generated from path planning, curve sampling, and learned path policy. They use behavior cloning to learn to predict paths given a start and goal conﬁguration. This is the first work to propose to learn this from RL.<br/> They do not learn a reward function, nor do they ever ask the user to compare two paths or trajectories. The reinforcement learning paradigm assumes an agent interacting with an environment consisting of states s, s, actions a, and the reward function R(st, at) The goal of the agent is then to discover a policy that results in the agent finding a policy π. The rewards are weighted with respect to the discount factor.<br/> Each policy π has a corresponding value function Q(s, a), which represents the return when following the policy after taking action. The value function is a function that represents the result when following a policy after following it. The function is the function of a policy that follows a policy in a state s. </p>
<p class="text"> Bézier curves are almost always smooth, espe-lyly when n is low, which make them ideal for tasks that require opening and closing objects. Learning curves for 8 RLBench tasks. The goal is not to outperform C2F-ARM on these tasks, but to show that there is no loss in performance.<br/> Path Learning can already improve performance when compared to C2F-ARM. Path Learning module takes the form of a behavior cloning tool that is trained on paths that eventually lead to the episode succeeding. This includes being trained on replays that have already been stored in the replay buffer.<br/> The policy is represented as a fully-connected network (with output sizes 64, 256, 256) It would need access to vision to be able to replace the other two modules. They use a mean squared error loss to regress the path policy to valid paths. They discuss avenues to reduce computational overhead in Section VI.<br/> Path is not directly given to the learned path ranking function, but is analyzed to see if it is valid. Path is marked valid if it previously resulted in success. Jπ(µ) = �(ξπ − ξ∗)2, where is a path that has previously led to success. </p>
<p class="text"> Both methods only receive 10 demos, which are stored in the replay buffer prior to training. The goal here is to outperform C2F-ARM, as these tasks require particular motions;.e.gopening doors, drawers, etc. The intuition here is that at the beginning of training, the predicted conﬁgurations will be undesirable.<br/> Path Ranking algorithm learns a ranking Q-function QR(ξ) with parameters σ, which are optimized by sampling mini-batches from a replay buffer D and using stochastic gradient to minimize the loss. The algorithm can become less dependent on the sample-based modules, and more dependent on its own predicted paths.<br/> Path policy is composed of sharedfully-connected layers (with output sizes 64, 128, 1024) Path ranking Q-function operates in the same underlying POMDP as the Q-attention. The reward here is the same sparse-reward used for the path ranking. </p>
<p class="text"> All methods only receive 10 demos, which are stored in the replay buffer prior to training. Ablation of the learned path policy on a set of 4 RLBench tasks. How often the path ranking function predicts the learned-policy trajectory to be the highest valued trajectory as training progresses.<br/> They are able to maintain the high performance of C2F-ARM on tasks where learning particular motions is not necessary. They use RLBench, which focuses on vision-based manipulation and gives access to a wide variety of tasks with demonstrations. Each task has a progressivelysparse reward of 1, which is given only on task completion, and 0 otherwise.<br/> C2F-ARM+LPR can improve performance on tasks where only a small subset of all motions are suitable. These include tasks such as opening and closing objects, and tasks that require a sliding motion. The results are unsurprising, as all tasks can be completed using a range of motions; i.e, they are all tasks that mostly follow a pick-and-place style.<br/> C2F-ARM+LPR attains similar or better performance across 8 such tasks. They aim to understand the effect of the learned path policy on learning path policy. The study shows that across 8 tasks, C2f-ARM +LPR performs better. </p>
<p class="text"> Figure 5 shows that there is indeed a beneﬁt to including the learned path policy in the ranking process. Figure 6 shows that the percentage of times the policy path is chosen does not need to be high for it to have a positive effect on the success of a task.<br/> They hypothesize that when M and B is sufﬁciently large, the change of a smooth, suitable path is high, rendering the learneded path inferior. In rare cases when no suitable paths are generated, the path predicted by the policy may be the only suitable path.<br/> C2F-ARM has already been qualitatively evaluated in the real world, and has demonstrated the ability to be trained efﬁciently from scratch. They run an additional set of qualitative experiments where they train on 2 real-world tasks from scratch, which can be seen in Figure 8 and 9.<br/> The project uses the (low-cost)UFACTORY xArm 7, and a single RGB-D RealSense camera for all experiments. All tasks receive 3 demonstrations which are given through tele-op via HTC Vive. The results are best viewed via the videos on the project website. </p>
<p class="text"> Learned Path Ranking is an extension to C2F-ARM, a highly efﬁcient manipulation algorithm. The LPR is an algorithm that ranks a set of paths generated from an array of path-generating methods, including path planning, curve sampling, and a learned policy.<br/> An interesting future direction would be to investigate how they can incorporate vision into the ranking and path policy, without loss of sample efﬁciency. C2F-ARM, by design, is agnostic to the number of cameras in the scene, therefore, the path policy would also need access to vision.<br/> This work was supported by the Hong Kong Center for Logistics Robotics.
