<h3>Towards Deep Industrial Transfer Learning: Clustering for Transfer Case Selection</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.01620.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> Industrial transfer learning increases the adaptability of deep learning algorithms towards heterogenous and dynamic industrial use cases without high manual efforts. The research was published in the journal of the International Journal of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering (IPA) in June 2018. The study was published by the International Organization for Research and Organization for the Human Organization of Scientific Innovation (ISI) in May 2018.<br/> The BIRCH algorithm is evaluated on an industrial time series dataset from a discrete manufacturing scenario. The appropriate selection of what to transfer can vastly improve the transfer case’s results. Deep learning has demonstrated to have a great potential in solving problems across a wide range of industrial use cases <br/> Many of those approaches successful in research environments are not yet utilized in industry. The challenge towards a wider adoption is the high effort of fitting, parameterizing and evaluating complex algorithms to the heterogenous and dynamic problems typical for industrial applications. A lack of automatic adaptability diminishes the benefits data-driven automation could bring and deters potential users.<br/> An appropriate clustering algorithm is selected and evaluated regarding its applicability using an industrial time series dataset. An appropriate algorithm is then evaluated in chapter IV and chapter VI. A conclusion underlines the applicability of the algorithm in the context of the intended usage. The paper concludes that one would still need to determine which previously encountered cases are worth transferring due to their similarity with the problem at hand.<br/> The term ‘deep industrial transfer learning’ refers to ‘methods utilizing previously acquired knowledge within deep ipient learning techniques to solve tasks from the industrial domain. It can be used to facilitate learning across different dimensions of industrial use caseheterogenous and dynamically changing assets.<br/> Heterogenous and dynamically changing data require frequent adaptions of any learning algorithm to always reflect the current learning problem correctly. The drivers of this heterogeneity dimension are economic volatility as well as shorter innovation and product life cycles that increase reconfiguration demand The driver of this dimension is the increased availability of data from within and outside the production facility </p>

<p class="text"> Industrial transfer learning is an umbrella term, incorporating methods from transfer learning, continual learning, and additional architectural measures to improve adaptability and transferability. The three dimensions of industrial use case heterogeneity create high efforts in data collection and algorithm adaption. Increasing adaptability reduces those efforts respcosts and, thereby, increases the chance of utilizing learning algorithms productively.<br/> A modular deep industrial transfer learning algorithm for overcoming the aforementioned challenges was presented in The main modules can be described as follows: The pre-trained input module (see Fig1, letter A) is designed in a multi-headed manner, i.ewith a feature ipientextraction submodule for every sensor <br/> The transfer module stores feature vectors on all previously encountered (sub-)tasks together with corresponding meta (or context) information. It can be easily retrained or replaced, eg. It is easily easily replaced or retrained. It is a light-weight, easily retraining or altogether replaced.<br/> Clauge-based clustering is the grouping of samples based on the similarity or proximity of those samples. There are many different clustering approaches, each with their respective advantages:Hierarchical clustering algorithms are distance-based and continuous, so that subsequent steps cannot correct the decisions of previous steps.<br/> The modular deep industrial transfer learning architecture is based on The architecture is designed to be modular and modular. The modular learning architecture was defined by, with cluster assignments and modular modular modules. The architecture was designed to teach students how to learn in a modular manner. </p>
<p class="text"> selective knowledge transfer is realized by comparing the feature vectors of the new (sub-)problem with those in the representation database. This similarity check can be based on clustering and take meta-information into account. The similarity check must be able to compare new feature ipientvectors with the constantly growing, multi-dimensional feature vector collection in the. representation database within a short time and with low requirements on memory and computing power.<br/> The clustering algorithm should be indifferent to sample sequence, number and dimensionality. It should not require initialization that would harm reproducibility. A lower memory complexity is an advantage because it allows larger data sets to be processed while memory requirements remain the same. The algorithm to be selected is an algorithm that is indifferent to samples number, sequence, sequence length, dimensionality and size.<br/> According to, inductive, implying completeness within the whole feature space, and transductive, allowing only the clustering of known samples, can be transducted. The computational complexity of clustering is an advantage because it allows larger data sets to be processed in the same amount of computing time.<br/> The BIRCH and K-Means Mini-Batch algorithms are at first sight equivalent and superior to the other algorithms. Both have very low memory as well as computational complexity and, as inductive clustering methods, enable online learning not only theoretically, but online learning.<br/> The transfer module is based on the transfer module of a cluster cluster. The module is called the "Portfolio of Cluster Algorithms" The module has a number of transfer cases to choose from each of the modules. The modules are based on a cluster of clusters or clusters of clusters of samples. The software is called Portfolio of Clusters. </p>
<p class="text"> The BIRCH algorithm is selected as the clustering method to be used in this work. However, the specification of a cluster number proves to be an exclusion of the K-Means Mini-Batch method, since long-term online learning of new problems may well lead to a change in the cluster.<br/> The experiments were conducted using the subset of a very large industrial metal forming dataset collected on a hydraulic press. The dataset consists of univariate time series data from several pumps applying pressure on a shared oil reservoir. There are 10 different production process variants (PPV)consisting of 100 samples each being used in this evaluation.<br/> The influence of training strategy and data sequence is examined. The data sequence influences the resulting clusters as well as their SI. An additional experiment using a dataset of the 10 different PPVs’ samples mixed results in 4 clusters with an SI of 0.728. Table II lists the results of those experiments.<br/> Already clustered samples can be added sequentially without requiring a complete re-training. In this case, the data sequence is dictated by the use case and a comparison with other data sequences is practically irrelevant. There are no deviations from the results in TABLE II, demonstrating perfect reproducibility of the clustering results.<br/> The length of the feature vector appears to have no influence on the clustering result. Figure4 depicts the results of those experiments. Figure 4 shows the results from a clustering experiment conducted on a dataset of 10 PPVs mixed using different feature vector lengths. The length of a feature vector is reduced to the dimensionality of the dataset’s feature vector.<br/> The Gipiparianicizedizedized Training is the name of the training program. The training program is called "Gipariano" and focuses on single and sequential training sequences. The program is designed to teach students how to use the training phase of the Giparianos training program. </p>
<p class="text"> The BIRCH threshold value of 0.6 or 0.7 delivers the best clustering results. The number of samples per PPV appears to have only a very limited influence on the clustering result with the standard deviation never exceeding 0.05.<br/> The BIRCH algorithm is selected as an appropriate clustering algorithm for test case selection. It is subsequently evaluated on an industrial time series dataset from a discrete manufacturing scenario. The proposed transfer case selection is capable of sequential training effectively indifferent to data order.<br/> The proposed transfer case selection is providing reproducible clustering results. Future work will focus on implementing and evaluating the actual transfer capabilities of learning algorithms based on the described industrial transfer learning architecture.
