<h3>Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators</h3>
<h3>Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.03243.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> AMOS pretrains text encoders with an Adversar-centric learning curriculum via a Mixture Of Signals from multiple auxiliary generators. The main encoder is trained as a discriminator to detect replaced tokens generated by auxiliary masked language models. The noise produced by the auxiliary generator becomes more and more plausible during pretraining, posing greater challenges for the discriminator. AMOS outperforms ELECTRA and recent state-of-the-art pretrained models by about 1 point on the benchmark for BERT base-sized models.<br/> The side-by-side training of the two models forms a pseudo ‘GAN-style’ (Goodfellow et al., 2014) curriculum which causes difﬁculty to improve or scale. A weak auxiliary model does not generate a hard enough pretraining signal to push the discriminator, but a too strong one can confuse it and worsen its downstream task performance. Previous attempts to make the generator and discriminator learning more interactive resulted in downgraded performance (Clark et al. 2020) </p>

<p class="text"> They present a new approach that learns to automatically select pretraining signals and constructs the learning curriculum of ELECTRA-style frameworks. The approach, AMOS, samples a diverse set of pretraining signal signals from different layers of an auxiliary generator. AMOS shows robust advantage across all included language representation tasks. It advances the state-of-the-arts by about 1 absolute point on average GLUE score and has competitive SQuAD accuracy. The advantage of manually-constructed pretraining tasks is more often observed in an application-speciﬁc manner, where prior knowledge about the target scenario is introduced.<br/> Electra-style models can be upgraded to more semantically informative ones. Xu et al. (2020) proposed the multi-word choice task which pretrains the main model to pick the original token from a small candidate set. COCO-LM developed a corrective language modeling task to recover the original tokens (Meng et al., 2021) Code and pretrained models can now be found at https://://://github.com/Microsoft/AMOS.org/AM </p>
<p class="text"> In general, conﬁguring a learning curriculum for neural model training is tricky (Bengio et al., 2009; Hacohen & Weinshall, 2019) It is unclear how to choose the size of the generator network and how to control the training dynamics of the generators and discriminators. The current practice is to enumerate different generators and choose the one leading to the best task performance of the discriminator, which is tedious and unsustainable. They train BERTBase-sized discriminators with 4/6/8-layer generators with different depths, and show their RTD loss on replaced tokens.<br/> ELECTRA-style frameworks are currently training side-by-side with the discriminator. This adversarial setup makes the training unstable and yields worse results, similar to the instability of GAN-style training in other modeling tasks. Hao et al. (2021) introduced a training signal difﬁculty-estimator to adjust the sampling of replaced tokens in MLM for more challenging training signals. It achieved better results than the original ELECTRA but still kept the generator training intact. </p>

The mixture weights over MLM outputs are learned to maximize the discriminator loss, by backpropagating an estimated reversed gradient gradient via Gumbel-Softmax. The discriminator is trained by the RTD333-3D-3 function of the generator. The generator is trained using MLM and RTD to provide different levels ofdif-culty training signals.<br/> They propose the AMOS framework that (1) employs multiple MLM generators to construct a diverse set of pretraining signals, and (2) adversarially learns the mixture of these generator feedback to construct more challenging signals. These two designs enable AMOS to automatically compose an effectively effective curriculum. Figure 2 shows an overview of the framework. They propose to train a single generator with multiple. MLM heads at different layers to mimic the effect of using multiple ML.M generators. The generator is partitioned into K blocks where each block is trained via its own MLM objective without being disturbed by other blocks. </p>
<p class="text"> The token sampling probability distribution pMLM is computed: The sampling operation is non-differentiable and prevents backpropagation from the discriminator to the generator. They leverage Gumbel-Softmax for a continuous approximation to the sampling operation for gradient estimation. The multiple MLMs’ outputs are always combined to construct challenging replaced tokens given the latest discriminator state. Such an adversarial learning setup can be easily implemented via a reversal layer (Ganin et al., 2016)<br/> They use the same corpus and 32, 768 uncased BPE vocabulary as with TUPE (Ke et al., 2020) and COCO-LM. They train for 4 billion (with 2048 batch size) samples, following research Bao et al. (2020) and Liu et. (2019) They add in OpenWebText, CC-News and STORIES to 160 GB texts.

It is now being used to test the reliability and accuracy of BERT bases. The model has been described as a ‘single task’ with a number of tasks to be completed.<br/> AMOS outperforms previous state-of-the-art pretraining methods on the overall GLUE score and SQuAD.

Val-uranues are differences (in absolute points) from AMOSBase. The study is based on suggested seman-centrictic depths in Tenney et al. (2019a) The researchers have experimented switching at different steps of pretraining but do not observe better results. Manual trials are tedious and expensive in pretraining and underperformautomatically learned mixture over multiple training signals.<br/> Using a 4/6/8-layer generator yields worse results than AMOS and previous ablations with the multi-MLM generator, especially on SQuAD. The 12-layer-based generator is too strong and makes the pretrained discriminator signiﬁcantly worse. It is simpler and more effective to grant the model access to a broader set of training signals and automatically learn to use them. Different MLM layers in AMOS generator indeed are good at different tasks. The 6th layer in the generator has the best performance on POS, constituent labeling, entity recognition and entity recognition. </p>
<p class="text"> Using different layers in the multi-layer MLM generator is helpful for creating training signals of different levels of difﬁculty and emphasizing different linguistic aspects. The discriminator needs to learn from the “mistakes” made by the generator not capturing certain language semantics. The 8th layer performs the best on the other tasks, while the 4th layer has worse performance than deeper layers across all tasks. They plot the discriminator accuracy (averaged on replaced tokens) in Figure 3b.<br/> The observations can be viewed as another progress of ‘data-centric” AI. Future work along this direction includes explorations of a broader set of training signals in language model pretraining, and better strategies to leverage different information sources in pretraining. The more diverse training signals from multiple generators and the adversarial learning design to effectively utilize them throughout pretraining can lead to empirical improvements without changing the model itself, authors say.
