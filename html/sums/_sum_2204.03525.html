<h3>Temporal Alignment for History Representation in Reinforcement Learning</h3>

<p class="text"> Temporal Alignment for History Representation in Reinforcement Learning is inspired by human memory. The method aligns temporally-close frames, revealing a general, slowly varying state of the environment. It can be interpreted as a metric that captures the temporal relations of observations. It is based on contrastive loss, which pushes away other samples from the batch. The method (TempAl) has been used to train the agent using the common self-supervised contrastive learning method. It has been applied to Atari 2600 Pong games from the Arcade Learning Environment.<br/> In this paper, they propose a Tem poral Alignment for History Representation (TempAl) ap-guiproach. They obtain therepresentation by aligning past state observations using the pairwise cross-entropy loss function, In more detail, they minimize the distance between the latent representations of two or three frames. This is a form of self-supervision, in which no additional annotation is needed for the representation. The 3 stages are iterated during training, and thus past embeddings can be modiﬁed to the agent. </p>

<p class="text"> They use the pairwise cross-entropy loss function to align the agent’s past observations and to obtain low-dimensional embeddings. They evaluate the method using the PPO algorithm using the Arcade LearningEnvironment (ALE) benchmark. The experiments conﬁrm provide a boost with respect to the most common instantaneous-only input. They show that TempAl outperforms the baseline in cases, where the history can increase observability. The source code of the method and of all the experiments is available athttps://github.com/htdt/tempal.<br/> In RL, observations are obtained dynamically, thus labeling them is impractical. In this paper, they propose a com pact history representation that can be processed with much-preferred networks. In the experiments, they use a small 1D CNN with kernel size 1, which has only 68 trainable parameters. They show in Sec. IV-D that the proposal improves the performance for most of the environments. They also present related works focused on rep-privilegeresentation learning. </p>
<p class="text"> The RL agent consists of two branches: instantaneous and history. The former is a common RL architecture, which processes fthe recent observations and outputs policy probabilities and the state value. The latter is designed to process embeddings of N history steps. In this branch, they use two sub-networks with described architecture, one for policy and one for value. They also include ablationstudies (IV-E) with only the history branch. Fig. 2 shows the full architecture of the agent. </p>
<p class="text"> They evaluate TempAl on the challenging deep RL benchmark They use all 49 available classic Atari 2600 video game environments. In all the experiments they sample pairs from 5 last rollouts, each rollout contains 128 steps of 8 parallel environments. For 14 environments they can see a strong improvement with respect to the baseline. In these cases, the history provides a clear advantage for the RL algorithm. A small difference with the baseline indicates that the game is likely reactive and the history does not add information. </p>
<p class="text"> They presented a method for history representation in RL. It is based on the idea that important information about the past can be “compressed” using temporal alignment. The history-only method performs better than random, thus the agent was able to extract necessary information in every environment. The approach was demonstrated on Atari games, the most popular with imagevations. The agent runs the obtained policy storing. the. embeddings for each observation, produced by E(·). Then embedding are.projected to 2D with the t-SNE algorithm.<br/> SSL has recently enjoyed remarkable suc-centriccess in the natural image domain, The representation is based on SSL, therefore TempAl can be used in environments with natural observations, e.g. in robotics. They believe that the work can inspire further experimentation, advancing RL to practical uses. The work was supported by the EU H2020 AI4MediaProject under Grant 951911. The author of this article has not stated that the work has been independently independently verified. </p>
