<h3>Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graph Relation Learning for Urban Metro Flow Prediction</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.02650.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> Researchers develop a spatio-temporal dynamic graph relational learning model (STDGRL) to predict urban metro station ﬂow. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on metro data in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Hangzhou. The research is published in the Journal of LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, August 14, 2015. The authors propose a graph relationship learning module to learn dynamic spatial relationships between metro stations without a graph adjacency matrix. They also provide a transformer-based long-term relationship prediction module.<br/> Figure 1 shows unique trafﬁc patterns at three different metro stations. The metro out﬉ow of one metro station has a prominent morning peak and evening peak. Figure 1(b) shows that these stations are connected to each other, the passengers’ inﬂow and out ﬁow of metro stations change over time, and thereare dynamic spatio-temporal dependency relations between stations. This dynamic relationship changes dynamically along with time and location. </p>

<p class="text"> The urban metro ﬂow prediction task faces three major challenges: Modeling unique trafﬁc patterns at different sta-centric stations. The spatial dependency relations between stations are re-arded as static in the existing work,,. To better support the downstream applications of the metro, it is necessary to carry out a long-term metro station prediction. The contributions of this paper include fthe aspects, as follows: A node-adaptive parameter learning module is used to learn different station-speci-centric patterns of different stations.<br/> The predicted results can offer a useful reference for urban metro operation manage-ishlyment and personal travel planning. The urban ﬂow prediction is important for trafﬁc management, land use, public safety, and urban public safety. The experimental results have improved prediction performance compared with the 11-baseline methods used by deep learning methods. The study was conducted on 4 different cities’ metro datasets, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengqing, and Hangzhou. </p>
<p class="text"> Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graph Relation Learning (STDGRL) model is a representation model with adaptive and spatial.structure awareness. In the metro network, the connection relationship between.oglestations is ﬁxed and static, as shown in Figure 3. However, a dynamic spatial relationship learning module (DSRL) isproposed, a representation. model. They randomly ini-tialize a learnable node embedding dictionary EA for all nodes. Each row of EA represents the node.embedding representation of the node, and de represents the dimension of node.<br/> The operation of the GRU module can be expressed as follows:. The output YS of the module YS is obtained through a fully connected network. It captures the long-term global dependencies of metro-station sequences. They propose a long term Transformer layer. The GRU. module is based on a network of nodes at time step t. The modules YS and YS are the parameters to be learned, X,.t and ht are input and output at time steps t. They are then used to predict the future of metro stations. </p>
<p class="text"> A Transformer-based long-term temporal pre-diction method is adopted for long term metro. This layer includes a multi-head self-attention layer, feed-forward neural network layer, and layer normal-like-ization layer. The attention calculation formula is shown in the following formula:. The softmax function is used to calculate the attention score of each position. These attention scores will be used as weights to aggregate information from different parts of the network.<br/> The Shanghai Metro dataset contains a total of 288 stations. The Beijing Metro dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. They use the deep learning framework PyTorch to implement the model STDGRL-GRL in this paper. The experimental equipment uses a GPU-driven GPU with an NVIDIA Titan V. V. It is based on the data of Beijing Metro data-swiping data from February 29 to April 3, 2016. In the Chongqing data, the card swiping data between 23:00-06:30 every day is deleted. </p>
<p class="text"> In this section, they compare STDGRL model with 11 baseline models. These models can be divided into ﬁve categories, including (1) two traditional time se-prone models, (2) two single deep learning models, and (4) one Transformer-based trafﬁc prediction model, and one recently proposed graph-neural network model for metro passenger ﬂow prediction. They compare STDGRRL model to a baseline model for time series forecasting, using linear support-support machines.<br/> The proposed STDGRL method has good performance in both short-term and long-term forecasts, as shown in Table 4. Table 3 to Table 6 show the overall prediction per-formform of the method and 11 comparative methods on three public metro datasets. The results of the classical machine learning-based time series forecasting methods are not better than the deep-learning-based method such as LSTM, GRU methods, indicating that the modeling of no-linear data dependencies in the spatiotemporal data is crucial when making forecasts. </p>
<p class="text"> The STDGRL model can learn the spatial and temporal relation from the metro spatio-temporal graph of different scales and achieve promising predictions performance. It shows that the proposed method performs well on a small number of stations and also achieves good experimental results on large numbers of stations. The experimental result on the fthe city metro datasets are illustrated in Table 7, Table 8, Table 9 and Table 10, and they also show the ablation study performance on the SHMetro dataset in Figure 6. The performance of the STDGR-NAPL model is lower than that of the STGRL-Transformer model.<br/> STDGRL can capture the trafﬁc patterns of different metro stations and the dynamic spatial dependencies between those stations. It can also capture long-term relationship dependencies between metro stations. And it also demonstrates learning the speciﬃcrying patterns of nodes is more important than learning the spatial dependencies of nodes. The model is a novel spatio-temporal dynamic graph learning model for predicting multi-step passenger in and out of urban metro stations in urban areas. </p>
