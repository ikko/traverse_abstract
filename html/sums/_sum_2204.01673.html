<h3>T*$\varepsilon$ -- Bounded-Suboptimal Efficient Motion Planning for Minimum-Time Planar Curvature-Constrained Systems</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.01673.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> Planning for curvature-constrained systems might require evaluating many (local) time-optimal transitions connecting two close-by conﬁgurations, which is com-hematicallyputationally expensive. They focus on the setting where a planar system can travel at some range of speeds with unbounded acceleration. This setting can model many systems, such as ﬁxed-wing drones.<br/> They show that by ﬁnding bounded-ishlysuboptimal solutions, one can dramatically reduce the number of time-optimal transitions used. They demonstrate that the planning framework can reduce the runtime by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art.<br/> De-termining whether a collision-free curvature-constrained path is NP-hard even for a planar system As a result, this problem can be discretized into a graph data data data. The graph’s vertices correspond to robot conﬁgurations (i.e., d-dimensional points that uniquely describe the robot’�s position and orientation) and edges correspond to local motions taken by the robot.<br/> The red and green segments correspond to settings where the system travels at the minimum and maximum speed, respectively. The time-optimal and bounded-suboptimal path obtained is T* and by T*ε using an approximation factor of 2, respectively.<br/> Given a start orientation (diagonal on the left or horizontal on the right) in an eight-connected grid, there are 68 unique transitions in total (after taking into account symmetry and rotation) to the adjacent grid cells. The computational bottleneck in these search algorithms is a frequent computation of local time-optimal transitions between neighboring vertices, obtained using nu-merical optimization.<br/> The key insight is that computing all the time-optimal transitions is both (i) com-putationally expensive and (ii) unnecessary for many problems. They introduce a novel algorithmic framework that allows bounded-suboptimal solutions while reducing planning times by orders of magnitude. </p>

<p class="text"> The search attempts to use only transitions for which the true (computationally expensive) cost was computed while guaranteeing the bound on the quality of the solution obtained. These lower bounds on optimal transitions are used to minimize the computation time taken to compute the cost of an edge or transition, also known as edge evaluation.<br/> There is a set of transitions that can be taken from any given conﬁguration. Transitions are computationally expensive to compute. The challenge is how this should be done while ensuring that the cost of the path found is within a given multiplyicative bound of an optimal path.<br/> An optimal path connecting two conﬁgurations (i.e., two planar locations, each associated with its angular heading) can be computed analytically. In this setting, an optimal path, also known as Dubins path, is one of six types: RSR, RSL, LSR, LSL, RRLR, and LRL, where R and L refer to right and left turns.<br/> Wolek et al showed that it is sufﬁcient to consider only the two extreme speeds and identify a set of 34 possible paths. Computing these time-optimal paths for a variable-speed-driven vehicle requires a numerical optimization that is (i) much more computationally expensive and (ii) may return locally-agnomarily optimal solutions.<br/> Kuˇcerov´a.a.ishlyet al[?] showed an efﬁcient heuristic approach to high-quality paths when considering time as the cost function by using multiple turning radii. However, there is no guarantee of the quality of these paths. The work builds upon the algorithmic foundation of T*, a time-optimal risk-aware algorithm.<br/> Wilson et al developed a fast motion-planning algorithm that uses Dubins Paths of various speeds to reduce the computational effort and the workload of T*. For the settings evaluated, the costs of solutions obtained by this algorithm are near-optimal, but there are no assurances regarding the quality of solutions.<br/> The problem formulation follows Song et alSpeciﬁ-.-iopcally, they assume a variable-speed curvature-constrained planar-centricrobotic system with unbounded acceleration. The system’s dynamicynamics can be described by (x, y, θ) ∈ SE(2) and (SE) ∉ SE(1) is the robot’’�s placement and ori-centricentation </p>
<p class="text"> Dubins path on the path connecting sstart to sgoal using vmin-like search for the optimal path. The optimal path is often in the same class as the length of the time-optimal path and shares a signiﬁcant portion of its transitions.<br/> They assume that they have access to two functions c : T → R and ˆc : T, c(T) and c(R) that evaluate the cost of a transition T is evaluated using c(·) Once the cost is evaluated, the value is stored in a cache-like data structure for later use.<br/> Algorithmic framework, summarized in Alg1, consists of the following two main steps. Heuristically computing the true cost for a small set of transition transitions. Finding a bounded-suboptimal solution while trying to minimize the number of calls to c(·)<br/> Each node n considered by the search is associated with a parent node n.parent except for the start-node nstart associated with sstart, which has no parent. Each node stores the time-optimal transition n.T used to reach a successor node n′ via transition n′.T.<br/> A*ε uses a FOCAL list that contains all nodes whose f-value is at most 1 + ε times the cost of the minimal-cost node in the OPEN list. Any node n for which κ(n.T) = 0 is prioritized before any node n′ for which c(n′) of the transition leading to n′ has not been computed.<br/> Among all nodes with identical values of κ, nodes with smaller f-values are prioritized. The true cost of n.T is computed if it has not been computed beforehand. The path is found once a node is removed from the OPEN list. Theoretic properties of A*ε and using the fact that ∀T ˆc(T) ≤ c(T), they have the following Corollary. </p>
<p class="text"> They report on empirical evaluation of the ap-ogleproach in a simulated environment inspired by Song et al They then move to compare the motion-planning approach to the approach with T* in static environmental conditions (SecVI-A) They then compare the approach to T* with a similar approach in static environment conditions.<br/> In SecVI-A–VI-C, they test the performance of the algorithm across 100 randomly generated scenarios of 14 × 14 cells. For a given scenario, each cell has a probability of 25 % of being blocked, and the start and goal conﬁgurations are cho-ishlysen uniformly at random.<br/> In some cases, they also report conﬁdence intervals that are two standard deviations from the mean. They provide a heuristic approach for computing the true cost for a small task. They report the number of calls to c(·) by T*ε as a function of the approximation factor.<br/> Using S1 reduces the average number of calls to c(·) by roughly 10%. When the step S1 is not invoked, T*ε is not “bootstrapped” with a good set of pre-computed time-optimal transitions.<br/> The Euclidean distance is the least-informative lower bound. Dubins path while accounting for obstacles is more informative but also more expensive-to-compute. It has longer running times when compared to Dubins paths that do not account for obstacles. They compare (Fig3) the three lower bounds w.r.ttheheticalnumber of time-optimal transitions computed by T*ε and its running time.<br/> They use Dubins paths without obstructions as the lower bound in the rest of the evaluation. Thus, they use Dubin paths without obstructionistobstacles as a lower bound. The path without obstructist obstacles will be used as a benchmark in the evaluation of a given path. </p>
<p class="text"> The average solution cost of T* and T*ε compared to T* as a function of the function of ε, as well as the running time of the algorithms. Figure 4.6: T*/T*ε is based on T*-like search algorithms over 100 randomly chosen start and goal lengths.<br/> They compare T*ε with T* in static environmental conditions, i.e., where the system dynamics are invariant to the robot’s position and orientation in the scenario. computing time-optimal transitions dominate the running time of all algorithms. If the dynamics are known in advance, these can be pre-computed in an ofﬂinelystep by T*.<br/> Using an approximation factor allows reducing T*ε’s planning times dramatically. But when the dynamics of the system are known in advance, T* may perform all its computationally-expensive operations in a pre-processing stage. This is not the case when the system's dynamics are not known before the query is received.<br/> To account for this more-involved dynamic setting, they cannot use rotation and symmetry between transitions to reduce the total amount of unique transitions. In this setting, the total number of time-optimal transitions is 512. The new model is based on the code for computing time-optimistic transitions, which is publicly available.<br/> The most demanding component in both T*ε and T** is still computing the time-optimal transitions, which requires two orders of magnitude more time than any other algorithmic component. They observe that the approximation fac-ishlytor allows for a dramatic reduction of the running time with little compromise on the quality of the solution.<br/> In general, increasing ε results in a dramatic running-time. In Fig5c, increasing ε means a dramatic increase in the running time. The running time is also increased by increasing ε to a dramatic amount of time per hthe.

<p class="text"> T* and T*ε in dynamic environmental conditions where the magnitude and direction of wind currents (blue arrows) are given at the bottom of the table. Average solution cost compared to the cost of the optimal solution and speedup in running time as a function of the value of ε.<br/> Wilson et al reduced computational effort by allowing the system to follow Dubins paths but using several radii. This approach reduces runtime, produces near-optimal solutions but with no guarantees regarding their quality. When evaluating their approach in windy conditions, the speedup in running time is comparable to T*ε, but the quality of paths remain higher.<br/> The main objective of their approach is online motion-centric planning under ocean currents, and no importance was given to the quality of paths. The path quality obtained by T*ε was higher (lower execution times) by a factor of more than 2.7×. Future work includes adapting the work for re-planing.<br/> The new model is based on LPA* to account for minimizing the number of transitions used. They suggest starting with an initial high value of the approximation factor to compute an initial solution quickly and then progressively decreases it as the time permits. They also suggest that there is a constant wind w = (w) and a constant change of wind.<br/> Figure6 Average ratio between each lower bound and the time-optimal cost is a function of the wind’s modulus. Colored regions represent the 60% non-parametric conﬁdence interval of the true value. It is ensured by the additional assumption that the wind magnitude is smaller than the minimum speed of the system vmin. </p>
<p class="text"> The wind component may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the turning capabilities (in the reference frame of the ground) The small-phthalest turning radius is obtained when ﬂying directly against the wind. The lower bound radius is divided by an upper-bound on the effective maximal speed of the system’s maximum speed and the wind magnitude.<br/> The second lower bound LB2 considers the direction be-tween the start and end conﬁgurations (s1 and s2) by computing the ground speed vG in the given direction d. The maximum ground speed occurs at the system’s maximum speed, i.e., |v| = vmax.<br/> Figure 6 shows the average ratio between each lower bounds and the true cost as a function of the wind force. The lower bounds reduce to the system’s minimum-speed Dubins path divided by the maximum speed in static environmental conditions.
