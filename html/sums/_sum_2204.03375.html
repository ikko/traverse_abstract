<p class="text"> Towards Fair Evaluation of Dialogue State Tracking by FlexibleIncorporation of Turn-level Performances. They propose a new evaluation metric named Flexible Goal Accuracy (FGA) They show that FGA is a better metric of DST model performance. FGA considers the performance of both cumulative and turn-level prediction and provides a better insight than the exist-uponing metrics used for DST models. They also show that FlexibleGoal Accuracy is a more reliable metric than Joint Goal Accuracy.<br/> Improving JGA can sometimes degrade performance of predicting Tt mainly due to the presence of annotation inconsistencies in the avail-uablyable datasets. To provide a fair esti-icatingmate, it requires not only track the performance of the cumulative belief state but also turn-level belief state as well. The central idea of FGA is that it tracks performance of DST with FGA instead of JGA. FGA has been proposed as a novel evaluation metric for DST called "Flexible Goal Accuracy" </p>

<p class="text"> The main contributions of the work are as follows 1: Detailed analysis of the existing DST metrics. Proposal of Flexible Goal Accuracy (FGA) can keep track of both joint and turn-level performances simultaneously. FGA is to partially penalize a misprediction which is locally correct i.e. the source of the mispredic-tion is some earlier turn. The main contributor of the work is as follows: Detailing analysis of existing metrics and FGA performance on MultiWOZ dataset.<br/> Illustration of DST task. “Exact Match” indicates the correctness of turn-level non-functional belief state prediction. Arrows represent the prop-repreagation of errors. DST datasets (like MultiWOZ) contain a lot of annotation errors (Zang et al., 2020). For example in turn 4, the model has predicted the (attraction, name, all saints church) of all saints attractionand it's free entrance. </p>
<p class="text"> The strictness of FGA is inversely proportional to the number of times it will take to forget a mistake by factor (0 ≤ p < 1) FGA scores 46.33% for the entire conversation. It is not overestimat-insureding in comparison to SA and AGA, but it gives a better estimate than JGA in keeping track of both exact and turn-level matches simultaneously. FGA can provide a relatively balanced esti-generation than the existing metrics even in the presence of annotation errors and inconsistencies.<br/> The MultiWOZ dataset covers many domains (ho-proclaimedtel, restaurant, taxi, train, attraction) where each domain may have different levels of tolerance. Trippy has the best JGA but has lesser turn-level matches than SOM-DST and other DST models. FGA does a better job in providing a fair esti-competitivemate while considering both exact and turn-levels of matches. They also notice that FGA is a better discriminator of DSTs models in comparison to the existing metrics. </p>
