<p class="text"> The combinatorial reﬁnement techniques have proven to be an eﬃcient approach to isomorphism testing for particular classes of graphs. They investigate the round com-centricplexity of the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on circulant graphs, i.e. on Cayley graphs. The number of rounds until stabilization is bounded by O(d(n) log n) The canonical labeling problem for this class of graphs has at most the same complexity as color re-nement. </p>

<p class="text"> A classical algorithm to test for graph isomorphism is the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. The 2-WL algorithm starts with a coloring of V 2 into colors given by the induced structure on the two tuples of a tuples. This coloring is re-colored repeatedly until the partition stabilizes. For many graph classes there is a k such that k correctly determines graph isomorphicism for all graphs of this class. With a larger dimension k, also the isorphism problem of other graphs classes, such as graphs of bounded tree-width and planar graphs <br/> A Cayley graph over the cyclic group Zn is also called a circulant graph. The Weisfeiler-Leman-algorithm terminates in O(d(n) log(n), where d is the number of divisors of n. They are going to interpret the 2-WL algorithm on Cayley graphs as a re-imagination of speciﬁc linear subspaces of the group ring Q[H] that </p>
<p class="text"> Every circulant graph of prime order has the Tinhofer property. They use this to prove the fol-lowing theorem, which answers a question posed by Arvind et al. and gives a ﬁrst example that isomorphism testing really works for a non-trivial natural class of graphs. They show that every graph has an algorithm to compute a canonical labeling [1, Lemma7.1] Theorem 4.2 is a slightly more general variant of Theorem 1.2. </p>
<p class="text"> They call a linear subspace V ⊆ K[G] a Schur-Ring (or S-Ring) if there is some partition C = {C1,... The Smodules are basically equivalent to partitions of G, but they provide a natural product-like operation that incorporates the group structure of G and they are linearized, which allows us to use the tools of linear algebra. For example, they can extract and combine elements of V into a Smodule.<br/> Let V be an Smodule, v = v = Gλgg an element of V and λ ∈ K. If T is the set of all g which appear with coeﬃcient λ in v, then also also T ∈ V. This follows immediately by applying Lemma 8 to v with φ(x) =.glyglyx = λglyx. And they can also take intersections of simple quantities in Smodules </p>
<p class="text"> In this section they interpret the 2-WL algorithm on Cayley graphs of ﬁnite groups in terms of operations on S-modules. For any element v = v, v, w in Q[G] they deﬁne the induced partition on G given by the elements of G with identical coeﬃcients. For this G is still an arbitrary group, but they pick K = Q. They also write P(x) := Pi (x) for the unique set Pi with x and 1 ≤ i ≤ n. </p>
<p class="text"> The 2-WL algorithm acts on partitions of V 2, which corresponds to G× G in the case of Cayleygraphs. The partitions that will appear are going to satisfy some extra properties, which allow us to go back to a partition of G. They say that C is a Cayley partition if the following:• for every P ∈ C they have that (g1g, g2g) ∈ P for all g ∈ G,• there is some P ∉ C with P = {(g1) | g ∉ G,; P  P  = {P1,... Pr�� = P1,<br/> The hypothesis says C((g1, g2) = C(((g1), φ(g2) for any (g1) ∈ G × G. The map φ : G : G → G: g′ �→ g′g is bijective and hence this lemmaproves that the ﬁrst two properties of being a Cayley partition are fulﬁlled. The third property follows similarly by observing that if L(g) = L (g) is L, g) then also L (G) is G, g, g′, g; G; g: g; g′; g </p>
<p class="text"> For a Cayley partition they have a lot of redundant information in any of the sets. Therefore they can pick out only one of the the equivalent elements (g1g, g2g) in every set. They interpret this as an Smodule. In this context the reﬁnement of Smodules corresponds to the steps of the 2-WL algorithm, similar to how S-rings correspond to the output of the algorithm: "S-rings" are given by the basic sets of S(C)<br/> The 2-WL algorithm associates to it the initial coloring of tuples based on the Cayley graph. But this is precisely a basic set of R(S(C), and both sets are partitions of G, and thus they have to be equal, i.e. Basic(S) = Basic(WL2(C) and Basic(P(S)(C) is the same set as Basic(R(S), P(S()) is Basic( </p>
<p class="text"> The 2-WL algorithm stabilizes the Cayley partition C after the same amount of steps as the reﬁnement of Smodules does on the induced Smodule S(C) The process of reconstructing a Cayley graph into an S-module is injective. The Schur theorem on multipliers states that S-rings are exponentiation-stable. They will use the concept of exponentiation by squaring to prove bounds on the amount of re-step steps of the algorithm on Cayley graphs. </p>
<p class="text"> The base case |P| = 0 is trivial. They compute: P p = (g + P) and g g ∈ P. They write: P (p) is coprime to |G) and by repeatedly applying the prime case they get T (m) The prime factorization of m is the prime factorizing of m. This is of the form: T (M) is the coeﬃcient of g in Ti · Tj is λi,j,j. The coe-ecient in Tj (Ti) is G (Ti), the co-e) of g (G) in Ti) </p>
<p class="text"> The 2-WL algorithm on a Cayley graph of a ﬁnite abelian group G takes at most two steps to stabilize. Theorem 26. is that any Smodule V stabilizes after at most at most amodule stabilizes. The algorithm is the result of Lemma 8. They also have Ti (n) ∈ V for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r, 1 < i < r, 2 ≤ r < r <i < r >.<br/> Every basic set T of V is an intersection of T (mi) and T (m) is the size of the basic set that contains it. The reﬁnement on V stabilizes in at most d(G)⌉ steps. If W is exponentiation-stable they have for g ∈ G and n ∈ N with n coprime to |G| that gn (n) n is the multiplicative inverse of n modulo |G) and hence they get δW (gn) = G) </p>
<p class="text"> In this section they interpret the color reﬁnement algorithm in terms of operations on Smodules. For prime numbers n this implies a bound of O(log(n) steps and for prime powers n = p (p)2) steps. For G = Zn they get that m1, m2, n are equivalent to gcd(m1, n) if and only if they are divisors of n. Theorem 1 is proved and they have Rℓ(V ‘) = R ℓ+1(V) for some. most |G| and can thus be halved at most ⌈log(|<br/> They have Ti ∈ V ⊆ W and thus also U · Ti ≆ RU(W) by Lemma 28. They apply Lemma 8 to T ≉, U · T1,... Uru(V ) ⊉RUR(W), RU(V) subsequentlyimpliesT Rur(V), Uru (RUR) and RU(RURW) in RU( </p>
<p class="text"> Let Cay(G, U) be a Cayley graph with U ⊆ G and C a partition of G. If ϕ is a graph automorphism it respects the neighbors of vertices. The color reﬁnement algorithm respects automorphisms of the colored graph. Then Lemma 33 (using Lemma 28 and Lemma 29) implies that: Proosition 34. Proposal: Proposal for the color re-algorithm on the coloring of the coloring C of Cay(U) to be the partition CRU(C)<br/> In this section they use the interpretation of color reﬁnement using S-modules to prove that all Cayley-glygraphs over Zp have the Tinhofer property. S(CR) is precisely the smallest Smodule that contains S(C) and is stable under multiplication by U4.2 provesTinhoferpropertyof Zp. They use the eigenval-likeues and eigenspaces of the linear map (U·) : C[ </p>
<p class="text"> P-th root of unity they get a basis of C[Zp] (coming from the representation theory of Zp) given by:apologeticek. For g ∉ Zp they get the expression:. For g Zp, they get:. The eigenvectors ek for 0 ≤ k ≤ p − 1 with eigenvalues for 0. k = 0. If there exists such an 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ p 1 with {u ⊆ Zp | u = U. U. as desired, as desired. As 0 ̸∈ U they have λk = |U| if and only if<br/> For example, they deﬁne the subgroup of Z×P that ﬁxes U as HU. HU is HU, which is the index of a subgroup. They write dU := [Z×P : HU] = (p − 1/|HU) for the index. The index of this subgroup is (p + 1) or (p) + (p = HU) The index is the group P </p>
<p class="text"> The lemma states that the eigenvalues have the same as the cosets of HU, i.e. {gHU | 0 ≤ g ≤ p − 1}. For any h,b : Zp → Zp : g �→ gh+b is an automorphism of the Cayley graph Cay(Zp, U), as they have ϕh,b(u+g) = (u)h+g),h+b = uh (gh+b) = uh+(gh) The map ϕ1,g0(g0) = g + g0 is an isomorphism of colored graphs, where 0 and g<br/> Every element g ∈ Zp with g ̸= 0 is in a basic set of CR∗ U(C) with |HU| elements. In total this says dimC V ≤ dU +1. In all this shows dimCV = dU and they can only have equality for the upper bound if every element g is in a set with gHU as desired. Then they can calculate what happens to the coloring of the Cayley graph after individualizing two vertices. </p>
<p class="text"> In Lemma 38 they have that V = E0 × E0, E1 × · · ·. · × EdU ⊆ C[Zp], where Ej is the space of eigenvectors of the multiplication by U corresponding to the eigenvector. They have dimC E0 = 1 because e0 is 1 and there is only one dimension for this eigenvalue. They compute for any g ∈ Zp with χℓ(g) = χ: G; T = T for any T ⊉� Zp; V is of the form µ1T1 + µrTr for some.<br/> The claim is immediately true, as there are two sets of size 1, given by {g0} and {g1}. Now consider the d + 1 smallest (non empty) sets of Basic(V ) given by T1,... and Td+1. If they remove the d − 1 remaining sets, this implies that every other set must have size at least |HU |−1-1-−1. All in all in all, the claim is true. </p>
<p class="text"> This shows that the dUd + 1 sets in Basic(U) must have total size at least at least. This is a contradiction as the sum of the sizes of all basic sets has to be exactly |G| = |Zp| = p and hence they get |T1| + · · · + |Td+1| ≤ |HU| in every case as desired. They claim that the elements T1,... (t1) induce d + 1 linearly independent elements in (td) eigenvectors ek for all k ∉ HU, (tk) and (tj)<br/> Chebotar¨ev Theorem implies that the square sub-matrix of the Vandermonde matrix is invertible. It is a contradiction and they get dimC E1 = |HU|, i.e. dimC V = p. 'P' 'Pg' 'p' 'g'' is 'g. 'g,' 'g.'' 'G' is g. 'G,' with g′1 < · · ·. · < g′ g′ </p>
