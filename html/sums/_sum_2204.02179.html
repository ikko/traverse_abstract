<h3>Towards Power-Efficient Design of Myoelectric Controller based on Evolutionary Computation</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.02179.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> An approach to design an energy-efﬁcient EMG-based controller based on Evolutionary Computation has been proposed. The current work proposes a supervised learning framework using a ker-giannelized SVM classi-classi-a-hnized classi.-Classi-out. The main strategy of design is to reduce false movements of the overall system.<br/> The training algorithm of the proposed supervised learning system is a general constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The EMG signal classiﬁcation has been customized and tuned for each subject based on the aforementioned strategy. The performance of the trained models has been evaluated on two different test sets to examine the generalization capability.<br/> There has been a considerable amount of progress in the research and development of artiﬁcial hands controlled by electromyography signals. The hand is a kind of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system which performs movements pertaining to wrist, grip, and ﬁngers.<br/> Poddar is with Department of Elec-tronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute Information Tech-nology Guwahati (poddar18@gmail.com) SSamui is with. Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering,. Indian Institute of En-giangineering Science and Technology (IIEST) Shibpur, Howrah, West Bengal 711103, India.<br/> The focus of the current work is to develop a supervised learning strategy for a robust HCI system for hand movement classiﬁcation The current work has been focused on developing the HCI controller. The controller is analogous to the brain of the entire system, which is supposed to map EMG signals to the user’s intended movements accurately.<br/> An EMG-based controller (EBC) is used to control an exoskeleton or a prosthetic arm. The EBC is used for controlling prosthetic/exoskeleton devices. An additional controller is also used for incorporating more functionalities in the device. The feature extraction process is commonly known as feature extraction.<br/> The design of the controller is determined by the type of the intelligence algorithm used to generate the controller output and the speciﬁcation of the mechanical hand-movement system required for the application. One example is the cyborg drummer where the additional controller is activated based on the background music to facili-ishlyate an extra functionality for a superior drumming experience. </p>

<p class="text"> An improved dual-modeactuator, consisting of ﬂuidic and tendon-driven mechanisms, was used in. The main challenges in moving towards a cost-effective and power--efﬁcient wearable prosthetic hand control system are the time and expertise required to optimize at all the stages in the process.<br/> Machine learning models can be trained to reduce the probability of misclassiﬁed movement of the EBC when at rest. This would improve the performance of the myoelectric controller, leading to a better experience for the bio-robotic hand users.<br/> The kernelized support vector machine has been considered as the classiﬁer, which is the main component of the EBC. The primary reason for choosing SVM is that they are well-suited for multiclass classi ﬁcation of various complex small-or-medium-sized datasets.<br/> An elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) has been used for the non-dominated sorting algorithm II (NSGA-II) The NSGA-I is used to the tuning of SVM hyperparameters (C and ‘gamma’ (γ) for the RBF Kernel)<br/> NSGA-II has been employed to solve a wide range of complex multi-objective problems as it uses a fast non-dominated sorting procedure, elitist-preserving approach, and a parameterless diversity-preservation mechanism. The main reason for using evolution-gianary multi-criterion optimization (EMO) in the work is that it attempts to ﬁnd multiple solutions with an implicit parallel search leading to faster convergence.<br/> The study uses a supervised learning framework for the multi-class classiﬁcation of hand movements using sEMG signals. Section IV presents the experimental setup and the experimental results are evaluated on different subjects. Section V presents the discussion. They outline the findings of this paper in Section VI.<br/> The dataset could be used to design EMG-based control schemes for prosthetic hand controllers for trans-radial amputees and muscle-computer interfaces for gaming. The difference between developing an EMG based smart-controller for a healthy patient and an amputee will be revolve around the scope of positioning electrodes on the recording electrodes.<br/> The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to use the design matrix to learn a hypothesis or function h : X ⇒ Y, so that h(x) is a good predictor for the corresponding value of y. In this work, they have used a kernelized SVM, which is a powerful and versatile machine-like learning model when considering training on a non-linear dataset. </p>
<p class="text"> A genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to determine the optimum window size and sliding interval for EMG signals in The authors have used GA to optimize the number of hidden nodes in the NN classiﬁer. A feature vector of a smaller dimension reduces the com-urallyplexity of the subsequent classi-model.<br/> A genetic algorithm-based SVM (GS-SVM) is employed in to distinguish between the muscle states representing muscle (fatigue) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) Various discriminative models based on linear discriminant analysis and deep learning architectures have been successfully used for different applications in the past.<br/> The performance of the SVM for any kind of pattern recognition task relies on the optimal selection of hyperparameters. The objective functions are implicitly deﬁned black-box simulations models. They have employed a population-based meta-heuristic approach that can generally find multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in one run.<br/> EC--based techniques solve any MOOP by assigning the ﬁtness to each solution. These techniques have a better ability to generate all the Pareto-optimal solutions, even in the case of a non-convex objective space. The EC-based multi-objective optimization approach takes two steps: Generate multiple optimal solutions and select one solution using higher-level information.<br/> In this work, they have used an algorithm called EC-based multi-objective optimization for SVM model selection. It implies that it requires a trade-off between the objectives among the solutions. The achievement of one goal would not necessarily help to achieve the other goal.<br/> The proposed ECMOOSVMMS algorithm operates based on the following steps. It creates the parent population for NSGA-II using hand-picked hyperparameter values (C and γ for the RBF Kernel) It then generates a child population equal in size to the parents population. The global Pareto-optimal set of possible solutions is deﬁned as the global Peasimal set.<br/> Performance metrics can also be used as a termination condition. Step 4: This step consists of the following sub-steps and they're executed until the termination condition is not satisﬁed. Train ythe model for each member (set of hyperparame-centricters) of the population and, calculate and store two per-formance metrics (eg: Accuracy, Recall, False Negatives) </p>
<p class="text"> ECMOSVMMS algorithm based on NSGA-II algorithm. The algorithm uses a genetic algorithm to sort the population into fronts using the Non-dominated Sorting Approach. The population is sorted using the non-dominated sorting approach. The algorithms are based on an algorithm that is based on the genetic algorithm of a population population. The results are published in Springer Springer, Springer Springer and Springer.<br/> The Crowding Distance is calculated for each front. The parent population is merged with the offspring pop-ululation and sorted into different fronts according to the different fronts. The new child population is created using crossover and mutation. The parents are merged into the offspring population. The offspring population is sorted according to a non-dominated sorting approach.<br/> The Crowding Distance is calculated for each front. A population size of N is selected based on their rank and crowding distance. The next generation will be started with the newly selected population from the previous steps. The pseudo-code of the composite algorithm is presented in.<br/> The dominance-depth-depth method uses the concept of dominance and compares each solution in the population. The worst-case complexity of this dominance depth method is O(MN 3) In order to avoid this expensive sorting approach, they have used a fast non-dominated sorting approach according to the NSGA-II.<br/> The front is sorted using f as the key. The members at the ﬁrst and last position of the sorted front are assigned a distance of inﬁnity (∞) or a very large number. Crowded binary tournament selection: This operator is used to choose good (above-average) solutions.<br/> It operates as per the following two steps: At first, two solutions are randomly chosen from the population. Then, out of these two solutions, a particular solution is selected based on the following criterion: If the rank of the two solutions is the same, then the solution with a larger crowding distance will be get selected.<br/> Crossover: Inside the loop of each generation, this is the ﬁrst variation operator after selectionCrossover is responsible for creating new solutionsThese new solu-uablytions explore the search space. The desired properties of a standard crossover operator are as follows: (a) crossover operator should not steer the search in any particular direction as it does not utilize any particular values.<br/> The crossover operator should increase the population diversity by increasing the variance of the population, it may lead to a premature convergence. However, the crossover operator may change the population's variance during this process. It may also lead to premature convergence, it could lead to an early convergence. </p>
<p class="text"> The proposed ECMOOSVMMS has used a simulated binarycrossover operator (SBX) to generate the offspring popu-ulentlation. The crossover is performed with probability (pc) The SBX is based on a non-linear probability distribution as given below.<br/> The proposed method used a polynomial mutation operator for perturbing any solution. The time and space complexities of various operators are shown in Table I. The EMG data is absolutely subject-speciﬁc Itimplies that they had to deal separately with each sub-ject taken from the dataset. Different models have been trained and optimized for different subjects.<br/> The limb position invariance is a vital aspect of the entire design process of this type of EMG based controller. All the performance measures are the average score con-itionallysidering the eleven subjects (nine male and two females) The model will be able to show signiﬁcantly good accuracy even if the test data comes from a different position (unseen during training)<br/> Two test sets: TS1 and TS2 have been created to evaluate the proposed system. It would help to validate the generalization and implementation of SBX while implementing the system. The test set is completely disjoint from the train set as it contains the data only from completely unseen positions (P2 and P4)<br/> NSGA-II based ECMOOSVMMS algorithm has been used for tuning of SVM hyperparameters (C and γ for the RBF Kernel) for each subject. TS1 includes data from all the limb positions (P1 to P5), including those completely unseen during training.<br/> The initial population for NSGA-II consists of some handpicked sets of hyperparameter values spread out over the search space. An SVM model is trained for each set of these hyperparameters. The Accuracy and False Negative scores of each model on the validation set are used for non-dominated sorting.<br/> The algorithm is run for 10 generations for each subject, and the best performing solutions based on non-dominated sorting and crowding distance are taken as the parent population for the next generation. The parameter β is calculated by equating the probability curve (dictated by Eq(4) to a randomly generated number u from a uniform probability distribution, i.e., u. </p>

<p class="text"> Through random mutation and crossover, the algorithm reaches the optimal solutions. The solution with the highest Accuracy Score and the best False Negative Score are tested on a disjoint test set. The ECMOOSVMMS algorithm is shown in Table 2. The algorithm reaches optimal solutions through random mutation, crossover and random mutation.<br/> An instance of NSGA-ipientII plots on the objective space (accuracy vsfalse negative) for Subject 10 is shown in Figure 3. The performance of the models obtained from the estimated Pareto-optimal set is evaluated for each of the individual subjects. They can categorize the solutions into two groups: (i) Accuracy dominant solutions and (ii) false-negative dominated solutions.<br/> The main purpose of this study is to bring in the multi-objective training criterion to reduce the false movements at a particular upper-limb position. The mean-rearable value of the metrics averaged over the eleven subjects has been depicted in Figure 4. Both accuracy dominant and FN dominant categories have shown superior performance on Test Set 2.<br/> The proposed ECMOOSVMMS algorithm is based on NSGA-IIHence, the algorithm is an iterative improvement algorithm that runs for 10 generations for each subject. The algorithm generated the optimal solutions by estimating a Pareto-optimal front. The algorithms are based on non-dominated sorting and crowding distance.<br/> The shape of the front remains the same. A new non-dominated solution is found which dominates one or more members of the previous front. This change is observed from Generation 1 to Generation 2 and from Generation 2 to Generation 3. The new solution is a part of the non-dominant front and the dominated solutions are not present.<br/> The NSGA-II non-dominated solution with the best accuracy score and the lowest False Negative score is tested on the Disjoint Test Set for every subject. The study has applied the concept of Pareto-optimality to an SVM-based sEMG signal classiﬁcation system.<br/> The proposed design strategy is aimed at reducing the number of false negatives of a particular hand-movement class. At the same time, it would take care of minimizing a cost function that accounts for the classiﬁcation error on a given training data. Pareto-based multi-objective optimization is the only way to deal with the con﬉icting objectives in a learning framework. </p>
