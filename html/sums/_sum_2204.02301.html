<p class="text"> In-stent restenosis refers to the accumulation of new tissue within the walls of the coronary artery leading to a diminished cross-section of blood. Restenosis rates are reported at 15-20% in ideal coronary lesions, the ﬁgures going as high as 30-60% in case of complex lesions. Neointimal hyperplasia is the underlying mechanism for the restenotic process. Patient-speciﬁc data can be integrated into the model to predict the risk and thereby assist in tuning of stent implantation parameters to mitigate the risk. </p>

<p class="text"> Drug-eluting stents have been used eﬀectively in reducing restenosis rates. Antiproliferative agents coated onto polymeric layers of the stents and progressively released into the arterial wall lead to substantial reduction of neointimal hyperplasia. But the incidence rate has not yet been reduced signiﬁcantly Suspected causes include arterial overstretch, disturbed ﬂow-patterns resulting in low wall shear stresses on the vessel walls, slow reendothelialization, and delayed polymer destabilization. An in silico model that can successfully capture the mechanisms that bring about neoint </p>
<p class="text"> An arterial wall consists of three concentric layers: intima, media, and adventitia. The distribution of the wall constituents in each layer determines the mechanical response of the artery wall. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), TGF-β, extracellular matrix (ECM) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are crucial in bringing about in-stent restenosis. PDGF is secreted by an array of cellular species namely the endothelial cells, SMCs, ﬁbroblasts, macrophages and platelets. ECM provides the essential physical scaﬀolding for cellular con-stituents and initiates </p>
<p class="text"> During the implantation of stents, the endothelial monolayer on the arterial walls gets denuded because of the abrasive action of the stent surface. Platelets aggregate at the sites of the injuries as part of the inﬂammatory response. PDGF and TGF-β upregulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production in the artery wall. In addition, a degraded ECM encourages the proliferation of SMCs under the presence of PDGF since they switch their.otypes from contractile to synthetic under such an ECM environment. </p>
<p class="text"> The arterial wall is modeled as an open system allowing for transfer of cellular and extracellular species into and out of it. Blood ﬂow within the lumen is not considered within the modeling framework. The advection-reaction-diﬀusion equation forms the basis for modeling the transport phenomena governing the evolution of species within the artery wall. Table 1 lists the variables associated with each species and their respective units in Transport variables. The hypothesis for the pathophysiology of in-stent restenosis is presented. </p>
<p class="text"> The functions are based on the general logistic function, and assist in smooth switching of certain biochemicalphenomena between on and oﬀ states. They possess values between 0 and 1. One can control the smoothness of the switching on/o�ae of biochemical phenomena by adjusting the steepness coeﬃcients lP and lT respectively. Growth factors exhibit short-range di�aiusivity within the interstitium of soft tissues. They restrict ourselves to the free mode of de-usion-based transport of growth factors. </p>
<p class="text"> The action of growth factors is signiﬁcantly localized, courtesy of their short half-lives. They are hence hypothesized with low diﬀusivities. Growth factors enter the arterial wall from within the α-granules of the aggregated platelets at sites of autoimmunearterial and/or endothelial injury. The migration and proliferation of SMCs occur at the cost of internalization of PDGF receptors post activation, which is modeled via a sink term. This phenomenon is taken care of by introducing the scaling function of TGF−β into the sink term (See Eq. 3) </p>
<p class="text"> Presence of PDGF within the arterial wall induces MMP production, speciﬁcally MMP-2. Interstitial collagen is cleaved by MMPs via collagenolysis, which is modeled via a sink-centric term in the evolution equation. Collagen catabolism results in switching of SMC phenotype from quiescent to synthetic due to the loss of structural scaﬀolding within which the SMCs are tethered. Figure 3 depicts the evolution of ECM concentration through a period of one year for varying values of the collagen secretion coeﬃcient. </p>
<p class="text"> Chemotaxis refers to directed migration of motile species in response to chemical stimuli. Within the medial layer of the arterial wall, SMCs experience polarized chemotactic forces due to PDGF forces in the interstitial matrix. The migration of SMCs requires focal adhesion sites for the extended lamellipodia to bind on to, which are supplied by a degradation in the ECM. The rate of collagen syntheticsynthesis can be controlled via the collagen secretion coeﬃcient ηE,th. </p>
<p class="text"> The eﬀect of PDGF on the proliferation of SMCs is nonlinear, a linear dependence is assumed in the current work. The proliferation term in the governing equation is linearly scaled according to the local ECM and PDGF concentration. At high concentrations of TGF-β, PDGFreceptors that activate the proliferative mechanisms become scarce and hence the proliferativity of SMCs is reduced. The SMC density is therefore formulated as a particularized governing equation. </p>
<p class="text"> The Helmholtz free energy per unit volume in the reference conﬁguration Ω0 is split into an isotropicisotropic part associated with the collagen ﬁbers. The extracellular matrix, is assumed to strongly inﬂuence the compliance of the arterial wall. This is based on the assumption that SMCs are the main drivers for growth, and they are considered a part of the growth matrix. The elastic deformation gradient Fe ensures the compatibility of the total deformation in the entire continuum. </p>
<p class="text"> The anisotropic part of the Helmholtz free energy is assumed to be dependent on the full C since any stretch associated with growth can still stretch the collagen ﬁbers. The stress-like material parameter k1, introduced above, is designed to be a linear function of the local ECM concentration in the reference conﬁguration c0-e. The Green-Lagrange strain Ei is calculated from the right Cauchy-Green tensor C. </p>
<p class="text"> A stress-free incompatible grown state can be formulated if they assume that the orientations of the collagen ﬁbers lack any dispersion. Mathematically, if κ = 0, Eq. 18 boils down to the simple form of a0Hi = a0i ⊗ a0I. The growth stretch can again be formulated under the assumption of preservation of SMC density as in Eq., or Ug. Ug is now suggested to be a form of Fg for transversely isotropic mass growth. </p>
<p class="text"> The evolution of Ug is directly dependent on the governing PDE for the evolution of SMC density. Boundary and initial conditions are summarized in Table 2. Table 3 summarizes the relevant initial conditions. PDGF and TGF-β enter the vessel wall as a consequence of platelet aggregation. The ECM concentrations and SMC densities are prescribed to be those of a healthy homeostatic artery in equilibrium. The boundary in the current current model is therefore Γ = ΓN.-N.-P and ΓD.-P for PDGF. </p>
<p class="text"> It is fairly common in the ﬂuid mechanics community to adopt the Eulerian description of species in the arterial wall. The bulk of the soft tissue is itself the transport medium, and hence lacks complexities like ﬁow reversals and vortices. The Lagrangian description has been shown to be accurate in the presence of moving boundaries and complex geometries. The equations which are transformed from the Eululian to the Lagrangeian setting read: "P.P. grotesque" </p>
<p class="text"> The balance of linear momentum governing the quasi-static.static.equilibrium of the arterial wall structure reads P + B = 0, P + P = 0. The Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress tensor P is deduced from the Piola.holtz free energy function by imposing the fulﬁlment of the second law of thermodynamics. The interested readeris referred to Appendix A.1 for details regarding the transfer of quantities from the Eulerian to the Lagrangian description. </p>

<p class="text"> The f(•) are therefore explicit functions of the rest of the remainder of the ﬁeld variables. Spatial discretizationEqs. 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37 are linearized about the states at tn+1 (See Appendix A.2) 3.1.2.3.4.5. The following is a fully-implicit backward Euler method with an implicit dependence on the f(2) and the semisimplicit back-to-the-front-eld method with the implicit dependence.<br/> The computational domain in the reference conﬁguration is spatially approximated via ﬁnite elements. The solution variables ⟨•⟩ and their variations are discretized using the isoparametric concept. The gradients of the species variables are evaluated using the derivatives of the shape functions that define the shape function function vectors. The shape function vectors are expressed in terms of the Lagrange shape function coordinates N L, N L (ξ, η, and ζ) </p>
<p class="text"> The gradient of the displacement ﬁeld is calculated using the matrix BU. accumulated in the matrix B. Substituting Eqs. 41, 42 and 43 into the linearized weak form (See Appendix A.2), two forms of grotesquesystem systiﬀness matrices are obtained for the two types of temporal discretizations. The resulting assembled global system of equations is hence unsymmetric, and forms the monolithic bipartisanconstruct. The resulting assembly of equations for the species in the arterial wall. </p>
<p class="text"> The wall species are ﬁrst calculated and handed over to the structural subsystem for calculation of displacements within every time step of the computation. An interface element is therefore desirable to incorporate the ﬂux boundary conditions described in Section 2.3. The general form of the residual contributions are evaluated on the respective Neumann boundary surfaces. The position vectors in the reference and current conﬁgurations are interpolated within the surface using an integral in Eq.49. </p>
<p class="text"> The position vector interpolation is accomplished using the surface normals N and N in the reference and current conﬁgurations. The deformation gradient necessary for the evaluation of the surface integral in Eq. 49 is evaluated using a surface integral. The bulk mesh is projected to the Neumann boundary surface. Additional contributions appear in the global stiﬀness matrix at the global nodes shared between the bulk mesh and the elements on the Ne.umann boundary. Bulk mesh projected to Ne. </p>
<p class="text"> The ﬁnite element formulation presented in this work is incorporated into the software package for FAP by means of user-deﬁned elements To evaluate the eﬃcacy of the framework in predicting in-stent restenosis, several examples are computed in this section. An unrestrained block model is set up and the growth theories presented in Section 2.2.3 are evaluated. Further, simpli﬉ed models representing an artery post balloonioplasty as well as a stented artery are setup, evaluated, and comparisons to the macroscopic growth behavior during in </p>
<p class="text"> PDGF and TGF-β growth factors are prescribed for a period of 370 days (approxi mately a year) on the ﬂux interface on the current conﬁguration. The in-vectors mimic the process of endothelium damage and recovery The growth models described in Section 2.2.3 are evaluated and compared within the fully-fledged monolithic solution framework. Figure 8(a) shows the evolution of wall species in the isotropic matrix growth model converge to those of the anisotropic growth model. </p>

<p class="text"> Comparison of the two growth theories. Stress-free anisotropic growth is observed along the direction perpendicular to the plane consisting the collagen orientations. Isotropic matrix growth is also isotropic at 0.3.3. As κ approaches zero, the response converges towards that of stress-free growth theory. A parameter sensitivity, study for those that can be deemed patient-speciﬁc, is provided in Appendix A.3 (see Fig 6(a)) </p>
<p class="text"> Using the isotropic matrix growth model, the monolithic and staggered coupling strategies are compared using the evolution of the volumetric change due to growth. The staggered framework also demonstrates accuracy when it is below 0.5 [days] (See Fig 9(b) for example) Growth exhibits a sigmoidal pattern, but the staggered framework achieves accuracy at 1.5 days. The model is based on the fact that the ECM degrades due to PDGF presence, and heals due to collagen. </p>
<p class="text"> The monolithic coupling strategy provides suﬃcient accuracy even at large time steps. Staggered strategy achieves mesh convergence for coarse spatial discretizations, but the solutions do not coincide with those of the monolithic one. This is attributed to the semi-implicitness in the temporal discretization. The displacement system on the other hand requires several iterations to achieve convergence via Netwon-Raphson iterations. Overall, the FEAP run time associated with monolithic approach increases drastically, which can be seen in Fig 10(a) </p>
<p class="text"> A quadrant of an arterial wall is generated in FEAP as shown in Fig 11 with l = 6 [mm], ri = 1.55 [mm] and ro = 2.21 [mm]. The geometry is meshed using trilinear hexahedral elements. Each layer of the artery is modeled with 3 elements across their thicknesses. The region where the endothelium is denuded is.merely.meshed with bilinear quadrilateral elements projected from the bulk mesh. </p>
<p class="text"> Most of the model parameters are taken over from Table 4. The collagen orientation angle α is now prescribed with respect to the longitudinal direction Z within the circumferential-longitudinal plane. Figure 12(a) shows the evolution of neointimal thickness over a period of 370 days, along the line with the line grotesqueZ = 3.5 [mm] on the lumen surface. Figs 12(b)-(c) show the development of the growth stretch ϑ over the time span. </p>

<p class="text"> A peak in the neointimal thickness is observed at around t = 150 [days], and beyond that a slight reduction is observed. The monolithic approach incorporating the stress-free-anisotropic growth model (κ = 0) is utilized for this example. The geometry is again meshed using trilinear hexahedral elements. To avoid the movement of the stent strut surface, nodes that lie on the lumen along the Z = l/2 line are ﬁxed against longitudinal displacements as shown in Fig 13. </p>
<p class="text"> A framework that can successfully model in-stent restenosis based on the damage sustained by the endothelial monolayer was developed in this work. The framework considers the molecular and cellular mechanisms that result in neointimal hyperplasia and couples it to the two theories of ﬁnite growth developed in the study. The model parameters are the same as those listed for the balloon angioplasty case. The stent gets completely engulfed by the soft tissue 180 days after implantation. </p>
<p class="text"> One key aspect that aﬀects neointimal hyperplasia is the deep injuries sustained during balloon-angioplasty and stent implantation. Quantiﬁcation of the damage sustained in the deep layers of the arterial wall, and addition of damage-dependent growth factor sources shall enhance the ﬁdelity of the formulation. The solid beam formulation (Q1STb [18) is relevant in modeling stent-expansion and endothelium damage eﬃciently. </p>
