<p class="text"> SIRZ-2 is based on simplifying approximations that limit its accuracy. They present a new approach to reconstruct the system independent properties of (ρe, Ze) and Ze. They adopt the deﬁnition of Ze from Champley et al.2 since it is a function of the X-ray cross-section with superior system invariance properties. The method is relatively insensitive to S(E) and the energy range of interest (30-200keV) </p>
<p class="text"> The reconstruction of SIRZ-3 is obtained by solving the equations (6) and (7) in (9) The weights for the penalty terms are given by wL.i = exp. exp. (6), (7), (8), (9), and (8) where N is the number of sinogram pixels (N/N)summed over all the views. Ze is a vector of all Ze,j voxel values, ρe is a vectors of all the values of Ze and ρ. They optimize z-score normalized versions of Ze.and ρ<br/> They solve equation (12) using the L-BFGS4,5 optimization algorithm. They use the python programming language and pytorch framework for implementing and solving it. Upon convergence and using (13), they use the reconstruction of the electron density, ˆρe, and the eﬀective atomic number. They also use the SIRZ-2 estimates for Ze and ρe to initialize the optimization. For LBFGS, they use a history size of 64, weak Wolfe line search, and a strong convergence criteria. </p>
<p class="text"> They simulated fan-beam X-ray DECT data at 256 diﬀerent view angles and 256 pixel bins. They chose various materials including pure elements, compounds, and mixtures with atomic numbers, Ze, in the range of 5+30. The noise around the Ze reconstruction is due to the near zero density of the surrounding air. SIRZ-2 reduces both the relative error (equation (14) and relative RMSE) in Ze and ρe reconstructions. They used simulated data to demonstrate the trends in performance as a function of Ze and object thicknesses. </p>
<p class="text"> The relative error metric estimates the bias in the reconstructed values by computing the relative error for either Ze or ρe. The second error metric is the relative root mean squared error (RMSE) The relative RMSE metric combines both the bias and standard deviation of the diﬀerence between the recon-constructions and the ground-truth. They compare the performance of SIRZ-2 with a disc of copper (Cu) with a diameter of 2.4mm and a maximum attenuation of 4.5 at the low-energy spectrum. </p>
<p class="text"> The relative error metric (equation (14) is used to compare the performance of SIRZ-2 and SIRz-3 reconstructions of ρe for various materials and maximum low-energy attenuation values. In Fig. 1 (c) and (b) show the relative error and the relative-error metric (Equation) is shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. They compare the relative errors in Ze and σe with various materials with Ze in the range of 5-30 and maximum attenuation. The reduction in Ze relative error obtained using SirZ-3 is quantiﬁed. </p>
<p class="text"> At low values for Ze of up to 20 (calcium), they see that both SIRZ-2 and SIRz-3 errors are within 1%. At low Ze relative errors, there does not seem to be a beneﬁt to using SIR ZIR-3 over SIR-2. For materials such as Fe, Cu, Brass, and Zn with Ze 26, they observe more than 20% reduction in relative error using SirZ-3 when Ze is greater than 22.5 (except RbBr)<br/> SIRZ-3 method for reconstruction of atomic number (Ze) and electron density (ρe) of an object imaged using X-ray dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) They presented a diﬀerentiable.forward model that expresses the DECT data as a direct analytical function of the unknown (Ze, ρe) They tested materials with Ze values in the range of Ze.5 − 30 and low-energy attenuation values in range of 0.5 − 5.5. </p>
