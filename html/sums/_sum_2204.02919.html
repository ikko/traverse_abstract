<p class="text"> Study of scalar ﬁelds is a major avenue of research within scientiﬁc visualization. Branch Decomposition-Independent Edit Distances for Merge Trees are faster than the only other branch-driven method in the literature by more than a linear factor. The paper was submitted to Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis) (2022) The paper is published at the EuroVis conference on 6 Apr 2022, Volume 41, Number 3, and is published on the XivarXivar Xiv. </p>

<p class="text"> 2F. Wetzels & H. Leitte & C. Garth / Branch Decomposition-Independent Edit Distances for Merge Trees. They present a novel distance measure for scalar ﬁelds and merge trees that is based on the tree edit distance. They describe a branch decomposition-independent edit distance that focuses on paths and branches instead of nodes and edges. This stands in contrast to previous methods that are either branch-dependent or focus on edges. Figure 1 illustrates two examples where branch mappings show better results than previous approaches.<br/> In Section 3.2, they discuss these methods in detail in the context together with the classiﬁcation. The work can be seen as a generalization of tree-edit distances without the context of merge trees. Other methods are based on topology-based features and topological descriptors. These methods can be used to track and visualize features in time-varying trees. The methods discussed above can all be used for this task (e.g. [LGW∗21] or [PVDT21) </p>
<p class="text"> 4F. Wetzels & H. Leitte & C. Garth / Branch Decomposition-Independent Edit Distances for Merge Trees. These are edit mappings or Tai mappings [Tai79] These are one-to-one mappings between the two vertices of two trees. They are induced as all nodes not changed within an edit sequence as well as those relabeled can be matched to one unique node in the sec-prone tree. The cost of the optimal alignment is equivalent to an edit-distance where all insertions have to occur before all deletions. An alignment or constrained edit distance is NP-hard [JWZ94]<br/> A distance should be a true edit distance (Edit Distance), should be branch decomposition-independent (BDI) and should use global properties (Global Prop.) The runtimes refer to bounded degree. The distances and arbitrary trees T1,T2 are applied using the same base metric (derived from a clear hierarchy of the recursions in [JWZ94,Zha96,Sel77]): de(T1, T2) ≤ (T1) ≤ d1, t1, d1) = d1.<br/> They will refer to these distances as dC, W T T2 and dS and by this mean the mapping method is independent on the used base metric (which means they do use the notation W T.T.2) Submitted to Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis) (2022) They will use this notation as a reference to global properties (i.e. persistence, birth, death, etc. of branches) while using global properties as labels </p>
<p class="text"> Pont et al. use a normalization-step as preprocessing to adapt the edit distance for geodesics and barycenters that modiﬁes the branch labels according to the branch decomposition. An outlier in the list above is the method of Beketayev et.al. [BYM∗14] (dM) They also compute a cost-optimal mapping be-insured between two branch decompositions of two merge trees. They usually compute the distance and the mapping simultaneously.<br/> The problem stated in the last section can be ﬁxed by using branch persistences instead of a branch-decompostion. Figure 2a shows two example trees where this problem appears. A practical example could be two trees where they apply a simpliﬁcation by persistence to both of them and in one tree the second maximum stays whereas in the other tree it is removed. The problem can be illustrated on the following practical exam-rejection exam-proneple. </p>
<p class="text"> They present a new approach that can be seen as a combina-uctivetion of the ones from [PVDT21], [SMKN20] and [BYM∗14] They use branch decompositions-independent methods to map branches of two merge trees onto each other. The new distance function is based on the new concept of branch mappings that are similar to edit mappings to branches of trees instead of nodes. It can be computed in O(n2 ·m2), which is faster than the only other branch decomposition-independent method.<br/> Given two abstract merge trees T1,T2, a branch map-ping between T1 and T2 is a mapping M ⊆ B1 × B2 with branch-decompositions B1,B2, B2 are arbitrary branches of the two trees. They deﬁne induced mappings as follows: branch-mapping distance function on merge trees and their branch decompositions. For example, they use a branch mapping function to map branches of one tree to branches of another tree while keeping the ancestor relations of the mapped branches.<br/> For ease of notation, they deﬁne for a branch-mapping M the set of all edit operations as grotesqueM = M. For example, M is M, M, a branch decomposition that corresponds to deleting the whole tree T. They can now determine the distance functions based on the branch mappings. The cost function on branches of two merge trees T1,T2, T1 and T1 is the cost of a branch mapping M. The distance function is the distance function between B1,B2 and B1. </p>
<p class="text"> They want to restrict the base metric for sin-ophobicgle branches or the branch labels to semantically meaningful ones. Formally, they want a cost-function c(a1...ak,b1...b1) between two branches to only depend on the start and end points of the branches, i.e. a1, ak, b1 and bℓ. The number and position of child branches should be irrelevant. They then call it a pure branch distance. They now show that dB is a metric on the set of all branch decompositions of abstract merge trees.<br/> The optimal map between (a) and (b) uses branches (0,10), (3,6), (5,8), and (6,8) These maps yield branch-mapping distances of 2 and 1. They then consider the recursion for the optimal cost of M for an optimal branch mapping for T1 and T2. They also consider the case where one tree is empty, i.e. it only has one possible branch decomposition with one branch, they can just omit recursions.<br/> They continue with the base cases of the recursion recursion.

<p class="text"> They use the structure of optimal branch-mappings shown in Lemmas 2-4 to derive a recursive algorithm that computes branch mapping distance. In Section 4.4 they will discuss this algorithm. They want to illustrate more precisely how branch-based distance measures relate to other known distance measures. They also want to compare the new method into a hierarchy of branch based methods that they have extracted from the papers describing the two closest methods on merge trees [SSW14,SMKN20,PVDT21].<br/> They present pseudo code-showing the algorithm for binary trees and discuss how to adapt it to non-binary trees. An obvious bound on the running time of Algo-Rithm 1 in App. F (supp. F) using memoization is O(|T1|2 · |T2|2), since the number of subproblems is constant, they are al-ways smaller than the current one and there are only many 4-tuples of nodes. </p>
<p class="text"> The technique is a straight Python implementation of the algorithm given in Section 4.4.4 and the constrained edit distance. Merge trees are computed using a C++ implementation and ParaView [SAL∗07] is used for result visu-privilegealization. Outlier detection is a major concern in ensemble analysis. They plan to implement such a method in future work. The three experiments described in the following corre-riddenspond to three different uses of distance functions between scalar-rear arrays.<br/> Using clustermaps to visualize the distance matrices, it is easy to see that the branch mapping distance (dB) distinguishes the outlier from the constrained edit distance dC and the Wasser-stein distance W T-T-2 do not. They make both datasets available publicly with the implementation [WLG21]. Figure 7 shows that the distance metric is useful for tracking applications in topology-based visualization. Figure H (supp. H) is shown in Figure 6, indicating that the distance measure is useful. Figure 7 is a heatmap heatmap from a distance metric for feature tracking within a time series. </p>
<p class="text"> Researchers presented a novel variant of edit distances that is tailored speciﬁcally to matching branches of merge trees. They showed that it is as ex-pressive as previous approaches on practical datasets. In future work, they want to investigate the formal foundations of path mappings. The new distance corresponds to the current 1 degree edit distance in the classic setting. They could generalize this with arbitrary paths of a merge tree. They also want to con-versely adaptions of constrained edit mappings, alignments, the gen-orative edit distance or even unrooted versions of those.<br/> They plan to investigate if similar distances can be deﬁned for contthe trees instead of merge trees. Hurdles to overcome here would be, for example, that paths in contthe. trees are not necessarily monotone, and the impact of saddle-swap.instabilities increase signiשּׁ�cantly. They want to look deeper into optimization options and also develop a parallel implementation of the algorithm. This could lead to a more ef� </p>
