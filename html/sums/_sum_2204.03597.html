<p class="text"> Imitation with Planning at Test-time (IMPLANT) is a new meta-algorithm for imitation learning that utilizes decision-time planning to correct for compounding errors of any base imitation policy. IMPLANT signiﬁcantly outperforms benchmark imitation learning approaches on standard control environments and excels at zero-shot generalization when subject to challenging perturbations in test-time dynamics. The goal of imitation learning is to mimic expert behavior from demonstrations without access to an explicit reward signal.<br/> Decision-time planning can slow the reaction-time of the agent, but can offer signiﬁcant performance gains. IMPLANT aims to counteract imperfections due to policy optimization in the RL step by using the proxy-reward function (along with a value function) estimated in the IRL step. Finally, the agent picks the action with the highest return and the process is repeated at each of the subsequent timesteps. They demonstrate strong empirical improvements using this approach over benchmarked algorithms in a variety of settings. </p>

<p class="text"> In reinforcement learning (RL) the goal is to learn aparameterized policy that maximizes the expected returns from an expert policy. They assume an inﬁnitehorizon setting. At any given state s ∈ S, an agent makes decisions via a stochastic policy π : S × A → S → S, A, T, p0, r, γ, r is the reward function. They learn the policy by solving a regression problem with states st and actions at the features and target labels respectively. They discuss the two major families of. imitation learning.<br/> The goal is to infer a reward function for the expert and subsequently minimize the inferred reward to obtain a policy. For brevity, they focus on adversarial imitation learning approaches to IRL. By simulating agent rollouts, GAIL seeks to match the full trajectory state-action distribution of the imitation-agent with the expert. Both BC and IRL approaches tend to fail catastrophically in the presence of small nuisances at test-time Crucially, both BC and imitation-learning approaches fail in large quantities. </p>
<p class="text"> ImPLANT (ours) is the IRL algorithm of choice for imitation learning. They evaluate IMPLANT on MuJoCo enviro-ments in OpenAI Gym : Hopper, HalfCheetah, and Walker2d. They obtain the expert data by training a SAC agent They use a limited number of expert trajectories used for training, as well as sub-sampling expert trajectoryories every 20 time steps. For each trajectory, they estimate its return via Eq. 4 and pick the action with the largest return. They repeat the same procedure at the next state st.<br/> Imitation with Limited Expert Trajectories is susceptible to causal confusion. IMPLANT consistently outperforms existing algorithms on all environments. GAIL-Reward Only exhibits the poorest performance suggesting the beneﬁts of explicitly learning aparametric policy. They also tested a Behavioral Cloning (BC) base-centricline; see Section II-A for a detailed description. They provide further details in Appendix A. The results are shown in Table I. and Table I, with the results in the first set of experiments. </p>
<p class="text"> They benchmark IMPLANT and other imitation learning algorithms under two causal confusion-confounders: action nuisance and state nuisance. At test-time, the agent’s performance drops drastically if the appended action from the previous time step is replaced by random noise (i.e., the confounding is removed) The results are shown in Table II and Table III. IMPLant is signiﬁcantly more robust in all environments with state nuisance than GAIL. The algorithm is zero-shot, unlike the proposed solutions of Fu,. or de Haan, Jayaraman, and. Levine <br/> They consider noise due to an imperfect model for a simulator that may not be able to account for perturbations due to drag or friction. They specify the test-time dynamics to be a perturbed noisy version of the training dynamics. IMPLant outperforms the baselines in almost all cases, highlighting its robustness. They analyze the effect of planning horizon on IMPLANT performance in the same setup as Section IV-A. They show the normalized perforfor-mance of the different algorithms in Figure 2. </p>
<p class="text"> Imitation algorithms for imitation learning fall into two categories: model-free during training and execution. They show that the reward and transition models are used during training, but not during execution. Decision-time planning in IMPLANT can further improve the data efﬁciency and robustness of the learned policies. The sweet-spot for the planning horizon is typically between the extremes of the model-based horizon and the extremes. The results suggest imperfections in both the learned reward and value functions and the sweet spot for the optimal planning horizon. </p>
<p class="text"> Imitation with Planning at Test-time (IM-PLANT) is a new meta-algorithm for imitation learning that uses decision-time planning to mitigate compounding errors of any base IRL-based imitation learning algorithm. IMPLANT is truly model-based in the sense of utilizing the inferred rewards and dynamics model both during training and execution. The algorithm matches or outperforms existing benchmark imitation learning algorithms with very few expert-driven models.

<p class="text"> They consider 3 continuous tasks from OpenAI Gym simulated with MuJoCo : Hopper, HalfCheetah, and Walker2d. They acquire expert data by training a SAC agent with ground truth reward and then recording its rollouts. They use a 2-layer MLP with tanh activations and 100 hidden units for all of the policy networks. For BC, they use a learning-rate of 10−4 across all environments. Table IV lists more detailed information about each environment, and Table V lists information about the hyperparameters and network architectures. </p>
