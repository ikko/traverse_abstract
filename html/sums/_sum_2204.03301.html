<h3>Sequence-Based Extractive Summarisation for Scientific Articles</h3>
<h3>Sequence-Based Extractive Summarisation for Scientific Articles</h3>
<img src="abstract.png">
<p class="text"> Researchers are spending an increas-ing amount of time reading and understanding scientiﬁc documents. Automated summarisation is seen as a way of serving a more con-centric version of an article to a reader in order to aid their reading experience and save time to acquire the necessary knowledge. They show that a sequential tagging model based only on the text within a doc-ument achieves high results against a simple classi-centric model. The paper is structured as follows: related work, data sets are introduced in sections 3 with the over-arching model explained in section 4. Training of the model along with all model settings are discussed in section 5, followed by the results in section<br/> An alternative approach was proposed by Jaidka et al. who used ‘Citations’1 to generate a summary of the document based on what other documents have said about it. This approach has led to developments in abstractive and extractive summarisation models, such as a bidi-centricrectional RNN as the base of the model This has lead to developments that have led to improvements in the model's performance. They show that through the application of neural-generation summarisation they can generate short (4 sentence), hu-glyman readable summaries which match a human baseline. </p>

<p class="text"> The data-set contains 138, 735 documents, this is split into train, test and validation sets. The training data for the model is generated by selecting sentences from within the documents that are ‘similar to’ the authorprovided highlights. This is in comparison to the CNN/DailyMail data-sets which has 4 summary sentences, with a average length of 13 tokens. The documents in this data set have on average 4 author highlights, with an average of 12 tokens per high-profile light.<br/> They are aiming to select the best subset of sentences, representing the main take-away points (highlights) from an article. As with and they treat this as a sequence tagging problem. The proposed models can be broken down into two components, the sentence encoder (see section 4.1) and the sentence extractor. This leaves us with the plain text, which is normalised and tokenized using the NLP processing pipeline from JohnSnow Lab. </p>
<p class="text"> The model was optimised using ADAM and stochastic gradi-ent descent. Models are trained using weighted negative log-likelihood which has to be minimised. The best performing model overall is submitted for human evaluation in sections 6.6.1 and 6.2. The CNN based embedding with trainable word embeddings is used to test the eﬀectiveness of adding additional features to the model. The inclusion of additional features with the sentence en-uvecoder results in a noticeable improvement in the rouge-l-f@4 score.<br/> The training data-set is constructed using greedy sampling, with the majority of sentences coming from the ‘Results’ section of the article. The best performing model extracted sentences with an average of 11.36 tokens, compared to the 32.43 tokens obtained by the best performing RNN. The signiﬁcant reduction in the metrics would then indicate that the structure of the document and the context which is learnt through the document level RNN is important is important to the model. This is evidence that structure is an intrinsic feature within the model. </p>
<p class="text"> rouge-l-f@4 scores for each of the six variations in sentence encoders. Models marked with a * when compared to the best model are statistically worse than the best performing model (푝 > 0.05) Table 4 shows that the model is not only looking at the text and location of the sentence but also the density of information within the sentence. Table 3:. the CNN based sentence encoder model with additional features on both the sentence and. the. sentence and the document level. Table 4:. The raters were asked to rate each set of summaries on a scale of 1 (low) to 4 (high) on four<br/> The raters assessed the author-provided summaries higher than the automated ones. However, the ratings for the automated high-phthallights are not signiﬁcantly worse than the author provided ones. The summaries were rated lower (but still favourably) on the informative and relevance scale. The model not only learns from the text but also takes the structure of the content of the article into account, bringing in local and global context to each predic-ative. The research presented in this paper demonstrates the ability to successfully apply neural extractive text summarisation meth-ishlyods to large. </p>
<p class="text"> Visfatin expression pattern of visfatin was ubiquitous in the various various tissues. Vixatin mRNA was most highly expressed in breast muscle and continued to decrease with increasing age in silky fowl. Subcutaneous fat and visceral fat exhibited higher contents of v-fatin mRNA in broiler chicken than those in silhy fowl. The MEAN model takes on average 24 hours to train compared to other models. Training this model takes an average of 11 hours compared to the CNN model.<br/> Using a basic RNN model, one can get summaries which are as good as those provided by the au-centricthor of the paper. Depending on the disciplines of a paper thereare varying degrees of reliance on the structure of the article. In further research they will look at the use of more complex sentence-embeddings, which can take into account tokens such as protein-protein-like names which are currently treated as random embeddings. The study was published by the Association for Computational Linguistics in Berlin, Germany. </p>
