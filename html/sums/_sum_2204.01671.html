<h3>Exemplar-bsaed Pattern Synthesis with Implicit Periodic Field Network</h3>
<img src="_sum_2204.01671.html.1.png">
<p class="text"> Exemplar-based Pattern Synthesis with Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN) Proposal is based on an implicit network based on gen-glyerative adversarial adversarial network (GAN) and periodic encoding, thus calling the network the Implicit periodic Field Net-Function Net-Work (IPF)<br/> IPFN is shown to synthesize tileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. IPFN learns high-frequency functions that produce authentic, high-quality results. The network is constrained to model the inner statistics of the exemplar based on spatial latent codes in a periodic encoding scheme. The design of IPFN ensures scalability: the.implicit formulation directly maps the input coordinates to the input.<br/> The synthesis of visual patterns is a technique that is applied ubiquitously in computer-aided design and digital content creation. The quality of synthesized visual patterns can be determined by whether they faithfully recreate the source pattern. It would be undesirable for a synthesizer to only copy patterns from the source.<br/> They want a scalable synthesizer to be able to efﬁciently generate patterns of arbitrary size. They strive to achieve two different levels of di-naissanceversity: the patterns should be diversi-centrica generated sample and across samples. They also want to achieve a scalable design choice: scalable design leads to a scalability.<br/> They therefore develop the method by pivot-inging on the fact that many types of natural and artistic pat-ishlyterns can be analyzed and recreated in a stationary frame-work. The goal of synthesizing an authentic and diverse pat-worthy work is to synthesize an authentic. </p>

<p class="text"> Generative adversarial networks (GAN) is one of the most promising techniques so far to model data distribution in an unsupervised manner. A stationary pattern can be modeled by a discrete ran-centricdom, where each random variable is associated with a patch of the basic element.<br/> In a convolutional framework, problems arise when fake samples generated from a dis-centric concrete noise image are discriminated from randomly sampled patches from a real image. A typical deconvolutional network that upsamples from an evenly-spaced noise image may not adequately address the previously mentioned problems.<br/> The noise map does not capture well the honeycomb structure as seams and intercepting elements are visible from the synthesized im-age. Instead of modeling the pattern with discrete noise tensor, they deﬁne latent variables in a contin-urous space. The extent of each latent factor is learned to match with the extent of the repeating elements.<br/> They term the network the Implicit Periodic Field-Field Network (IPFN) They validate the proposed design by showing various ap-urousplications in texture image synthesis and 3D volume syn-uctivethesis in Section44. They design a conditional formulation of the model to tackle the synthesis of directional patterns.<br/> Pattern Synthesis synthesizes patterns from smooth interpo-procedural noise and create aesthetically pleasing materials that display a high level of randomness Recent works related to us utilize randomness from a continuously-deﬁned Perlin noise to synthesize textures in an implicit form.<br/> Traditional image synthesis is divided into pixel-based method (e.g[7, 16, 18) and patch-based methods. The efforts are focused on ”quilting” the discontinuity between patches and encouraging global similarity. </p>
<p class="text"> Recent advances in implicit net-work have found a Fourier feature mapping with a set of sinusoids effective in learning high-frequency patterns. This allows the pattern of the pattern to be repeated, and the time it is used to be used to learn the pattern.<br/> A noise function that is smoothly deﬁned in the real coordi-heticalnate space encourages smooth transition between the syn-privacythesized patches. In a 2D example, they start with a discrete random random ﬁeld that maps a uniform grid of coordinates to ran-centricdom variables {fz(c) | c : RH×W ×2) Then the discrete random ﬀeld is smoothly interpolated to form<br/> Conditional IPFN enables many practical applications. They outline two applications in pattern synthesis using the conditional formulation: the pattern synthesis of directional pattern. The model is able to model patch-centric patterns along a speci-ditional direction. For simplic-urousity, they present a 2D formulation that can be easily extended to 3D.<br/> With a user-deﬁned implicit 2D line-tracking algorithm ax+by+c = 0, the guidance factor is de-privilege as g(x, y) = ax + by + c. Pixel coordinates (px, py) are transformed as (x) = (2p) and (p) w and height (w) are normalized to the value range of [−1, 1)<br/> The overall structure of IPFN is visualized in Figure 2.4. The Generator Network G is a 10-layer MLP with ReLUactivations between layers and a sigmoid function in the end. An intuitive exam-inatoryple of this application can be found in Section 4.5. </p>
<p class="text"> Using IPFN, IPFN is adapted to two applications in 3D tex-turing and shape manipulation. They hypothesize that the approach is most suitable for synthe-synthesizing texture patterns and 3D shapes with repeating-structures and local variations in appearance.<br/> In the evaluation, they present comparisons of visual results that are self-manifesting. In addition, they have provided quantiﬁ-insuredable metrics in terms of Single Image Frech´et Inception Dis tance and inference time and memory. For all of the experiments, the network is optimized under WGAN loss.<br/> IPFN only requires 24 milliseconds to generate a 1024 × 1024 image3D volumes. A large-scale 5123 volume takes only 22.9 seconds to generate. Source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the IPFN code. The IPFN is typically trained for 12,500 itera-centrictions with a batch size of 8 and runs on a single Nvidia GTX6801080 GPU.<br/> IPFN synthesizes visually similar patterns in both situations. Images were randomly cropped into patches of size 128×128 and 512× 512. Images are scaled up fthe times to a size of 512 × 512. The synthesized results were obtained from running the ofﬁcially released code.<br/> IPFN has provided the most vi-sually authentic results among baselines among the baselines. The IPFN synthesizes periodicsamples that display diversity across samples and similarity to the stationary exemplars, their synthesized patterns lack a higher level of local variations and adapt well to the directional cases.<br/> IPFN provides a more direct approach to synthesizing diversiﬁed samples from random noise. However, in the stationary cases, radial distortion is noticeable near the roughly boundaries of its synthesized images. IPFN can synthesize samples without re-quiring image input. </p>
<p class="text"> Figure 3 shows main results for 2D texture synthesis with comparisons to Henzler et al and Bergmann et. al on the same resolution as the original exemplars. Table 1 shows the SIFID comparisons between the synthesized patterns and the baselines in various categories.<br/> Zhou et al achieves the best performance as its method speciﬁcally targets non-stationary expansions. Table 2 measures the in-ference time and memory consumption of the network com-pterpared to the baselines when generating image at different sizes.<br/> The implicit formulation was shown to be signiﬁcantly signi ﬁtantantantistic. The implicit formulation of the implicit formulation is shown to have a strong effect on the view of the world. They are happy to clarify that this is not the same as the previous formulation of this formulation. </p>
<p class="text"> A network model encodes input coordinates without the learnable param-eters a described in Section 3.1. This validates the claim on scalability of the design. The network model. more efﬁcient in both time and space without the needs to rely on computation of pseudo-random noise ( [12) or con-volutional operations.<br/> w/o shift is a model that is trained without randomly shifting the input coordinates. When coordinates are encoded at a ﬁxed scale, the W/o deformation model generates hexagons that are seem-ishly glued together as the presumed scale does not match the actual period of the repeating structure.<br/> For the foam structure, they have sampled 200 × 200 × 128 points and extracted 32 × 32 patches during training. During inference, porous structures are synthesized at their original resolution, while they scale thesynthesized foam structures to be twice as large as the orig-ipientinal shape in the XY direction.<br/> IPFN learns multi-channel textures that are applicable to seamless 3D texturing. The original 3D texture in this example is not symmetric and therefore visible seams can be found on the surface. The patterns learnt from this exemplar can be tiled in any direction, the mapped surface is seamless. </p>
<p class="text"> IPFN can synthesize a foam structure with smoothly changing densities. The periodic nature of the synthesized patterns allows IPFN to create textures that are mirror-symmetric. This property provides an immediate appurportedlyplication to seamless 3D texture mapping. The original 9-channel texture is tiled and directly mapped to a planar surface.<br/> The original foam shape used in the experiment contains holes of various sizes, which corresponds to the density of the foam structure. When repeatedly mapped to the surface, the symmetric texture is seamless while faithfully re-ecting the appearance and structure of the original texture. The main limitation of the method is its emphasis on modeling stationary patterns.<br/> The method does not provide a way to address a class of patterns that are radial, which are exem-plipliﬁed by web structures and spiral patterns. While the synthesized landscape appears globally sim-cularilar to the exemplar, some local regions contain ”fading-out” elements that are blended with the background.<br/> A multi-scale synthesis approach strikes a good balance between learning the distribution of global structure and local, high-frequency details of an image. They believe there are still ample opportunities for the extension of the methods to a broader range of 3D applications.
