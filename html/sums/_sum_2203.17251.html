<p class="text">  Continuous Scene Representations for Embodied AI (CSR) can track objects as the agent moves in a scene, up-date the representation accordingly, and detect changes in room conﬁgurations. CSR is a method that captures feature relationships between objects, and situ-typicallyates an embodied agent within the representation.<br/> Using CSR, they outperform state-of-the-art approaches for the challenging downstream task of visual room rearrangement, without any task speciﬁc train-training. They show the learned embeddings capture highly spatial details of the scene and show applicability to real world data.<br/> ContinuousScene Representations encodes object relationships into a graph with nodes and edges represented as feature vectors. As the agent moves within a trajec-centrictory, new nodes are populated. As a result, different embeddings al-agoguelow for change detection.<br/> Scene graphs used in the literature are typically static (i.e., they represent a snap-shot of a scene or a bundle of frames) If an agent returns to a position, it should determine if objects have moved. The re-lationship ‘table supports mug’ indicates the mug is on the table, but it does not capture where. </p>

<p class="text">  Inspired by these observations, they develop a scene rep-resentation that is more suitable for embodied AI tasks. The goal is to represent relations between objects as continuous vec               tors and update the representation on-the-renewly as the agent moves. The graph should accommodate the new objects, and relationships with other objects should also determine when detections correspond to the same object.<br/> To tackle these challenges, the idea is to learn object relational embeddings via a contrastive loss to repre-sent the nodes and edges of a scene representation. They perform experiments using the AI2-THOR framework and the YCB-Video dataset.<br/> A CSR trained on AI2-THOR is able to track objects over time in real world YCB-Video , which contains objects unseen during training. CSR effectively captures spatial relation-ship between objects within a scene. Without any hyperparameter tuning, a CSR can be used to identify or track changes in a scene over time.<br/> These types of scene graphs capture temporal information; how-ever, they are created using pre-recorded videos. They are not suitable for embodied tasks that involve observations de-ishlypendent on on-the-ﬂy actions. The method is closer to the approaches that create scene graphs in em-ensiblybodied or physics based settings <br/> Scene graphs are a form of form ofraction for metric-semantic maps, so they discuss exam-gianples of mapping work. Scene graphs represent a continuous representation of the scene, rather than a dense representation. They cre-gianate a continuous visual representation of a scene. The method produces an abstract sparse rep-naissanceresentation rather than an abstract representation.<br/> Neural graph-based and dense representations have been proposed to construct the map of the environment. (3) Methods such as require a full sequence of observations as in-put, which is not suitable for embodied applications.<br/> Embodied AI requires an agent to have an understanding of the environment and to update its knowledge based on new observations. In this paper, the goal is to model scenes with the Continuous Scene Representations (CSR), whichcan then be used in downstream visual and embodied tasks. </p>
