<p class="text"> The self-attention mechanism calculates a correlation score for each word with respect to the other words in a sentence. The attention score for a word determines highly correlated words; the rest are merely irrelevant. There exists a threshold that differentiates between scores of the words that need to be considered and those that do not define the context and thus inconsequential. LeOPArd yields 1.9√óand 3.9X speedup and 2.9x energy reduction, while keeping the average accuracy intact < 0.2% degradation.<br/> A key contribution of this work is to formulate finding the layer-wise pruning thresholds as a differentiable regularizer. This formulation leverages the gradient-based back-propagation algorithm to mathematically co-optimize the threshold values and weight parameters. The proposed approach is analytical and therefore mathematically sound, and does not rely on limited empirical evidence. The solution also guarantees the same generality and optimality that are essential for the machine learning model itself. At runtime, attention scores below the learned threshold are replaced by ‚àí‚àûognitiveto void their impact on the attention layer‚Äôs outputs. </p>

<p class="text"> The LeOPArd accelerator offers 1.9√ó and 3.9x energy reduction compared to a baseline design without pruning and bit-level early termination. The accelerator‚Äôs notable pruning rate can unlock more benefits, if more chip area budget (15%) is available. The results suggest that formulating runtime pruning as a gradient-based optimization can unlock significant benefits, while guaranteeing inference accuracy. The next step is leveraging arithmetic insights for early termination in the microarchitecture without approximation.<br/> The self-attention values are calculated as follows:. (P) P, (A) P) and (A), (C) P/A) are applied to each row of Score matrix as follows. Each head captures different dependencies between the token-embeddings. In this case, the attention values are concatenated and projected into an attention matrix. They propose an alternative pruning mechanism that learns the threshold as part of training. The proposed technique eliminates the ineffectual computations of ‚Äúsoftmax(¬∑)‚Äù in Equation 4. </p>
<p class="text"> They apply the gradient-based learned prun-centricing as a light fine-tuning step based on the previously proposed design principles: (1) pruning with soft threshold and (2) differ-ridden surrogate L0 regularization. They employ the pre-trained attention models with the proposed modified loss function (e.g..), to jointly fine-tune the model parameters and learn the per-layer pruning thresholds. Figure 2 demonstrates an example sparsity, threshold values, and normalized training loss curves for BERT-B model on QNLI task from GLUE benchmark.<br/> The flexibility afforded by the joint co-training isfurther illustrated at the third epoch, where the sparsity continues to increase despite the corresponding decrease in the threshold value. Figure 2b shows the decreasing trend of normalized training loss over the course of fine-tuning epochs. They propose to compute and add a dynamically adjusted conservative margin value to the partial-sum during the bit-serial computations. The margin is adjusted to accommodate the largest possible positive contribution to the final value. In the second cycle, because the sum of P2 and M2 dips below the threshold, the computation process terminates. </p>

The study was presented at a conference in Washington, DC, USA, July 17, 2017, at the University of Washington, D.C. University of California, California, University of New York, New York and University of Cambridge, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New England. The study is called "Accelerating Attention Through Gradient Based Learned Learned Learned Pruning," and the study will focus on how to reduce stress and anxiety.<br/> Cycle = 2. 2. 3. 2. 2. 1. 2: 2. 4: 2: 3: 2; 2: 1: 2, 2: 4: 1. 3: 12: 5: 23: 3. 1: 1; 1: The cycle is comprised of two cycles.

Cycle Cycle cycle length: 3 cycles at 3 cyclers; cycle cycle starts at 1 cycle cycle at 3, cycle cycle 2 cycles at 2 cycles.<br/> A front-end unit, dubbed QK-PU, streams in the Q vectors (row by row from the ùëÑ matrix, where each row corresponds to a word) from the off-chip memory, reads Ks from a local buffer, and performs vector-matrix multiplyication between a Q vector and a K matrix. The table shows the partial sum values after each cycle. Figure 4 illustrates the high-level microarchitecture of a single LeOPArd tile.<br/> The LeOPArd front-end unit (depicted in Figure 4-(a)) is a collection of bit-serial dot-product units (QK-DPU) The back-end (V-PU) employs multiple (ùëÅQK) QKs while using a single V-PU in consideration of high pruning rate during the processing. The choice of QK is a key factor to maximize the overall throughput and resource utilization, they explore this design space in Section 5.4.<br/> Figure 5-(a) depicts the mi-glycroarchitectural details of the Bit-Serial Dot-product Engine. The BS-DPE is a collection of Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) simulations. The QK-DPU reads the next Q vector from Q-FIFO and starts processing the next K vector.

They chose a 2-bit serial execu-protective design as it strikes the right balance between power efficiency and performance. QK-DPU is a bit-serial dot-product engine, (b) margin-calculation logic, (c) thresholding module, and (d) score index counter.<br/> The margin needs to be calculated dynamically for each bit position during bit-centric execution (such as M changing in each row of the Table in Figure 3) This is enabled by subtracting the shifted version of Sum-Cntr value from the current margin in the margin register. The margin calculation is a scalar-centriccomputation (mostly shift and subtraction) which is amortized over the ùëë = 64 dimension vector processing, incurring virtually no over-head. They implemented the Softmax module of V-PU similarly to the Look-Up-Table.<br/> LeOPArd leverages the provided pruning by the front-end stage and eliminates the inconsequential computations. They evaluate LeOPard on various NLP and Vision models: BERT-Base (BERT-B) and BERT-Large, MemN2N and MemT-Base To evaluate these models, they use five models: AlberT-XX-Large (ALBERT </p>
<p class="text"> The on-chip mem-ory sizes for K and V are designed to store up to 512 sequences for a single head layer for both head-placing and simulations. Table 1 lists the microarchitectural pa-henyrameters of a single LeOPArd tile for two studied configurations: (1)A LeOP Ard tile with six and (2) eight QK-DPUs that share a single MAC array in V-PUs. The sequence length is 50 for MemN2N with Facebook bAbI whereas 512 and 384 for BERT and ALBERT-XX-L models with a single task for GPT-2-L, respectively.<br/> They compare LeOPArd to a conventional baseline design without any of the optimizations, e.g. runtime pruning and bit-level early compute termination. They also use a simulator to obtain the total cycle counts and the number of accesses to memories for both LeOP Ard and baseline.accelerators. They use the same frequency, bitwidths for Q√óKùëá and √óV, and on-chip memory capacity for all the designs. For the SRAM onchip memoryblocks, they use Memory Compiler with ARM High density 65 nm.GP 6-transistor based single-port SRAM version r0p0 <br/> On average, across all the tasks, LeOPArd degrades accuracy by only 0.07% for MemN2N with the bAbi dataset, 0.31% and 0.33% for the GLUE dataset.

<p class="text"> Researchers from Ghodrati, Yazdanbakhsh, et al. published their findings at a conference in Washington DC, DC, USA, on July 17, 2017. They compared the effectiveness of BitFusion with LeOPArd‚Äôs robusturan Pruning to improve the accuracy of the Pruning tool. The Pruning Tool is based on the reliability and accuracy of Pruning. Pruning can be used to improve accuracy and accuracy in Pruning and Pruning tools.<br/> Accuracy before and after pruning-aware fine-tuning (prefix "G-": discuss GLUE). 2.45.45-0.73G-SST.69-69.69.02.02 (g-STS.2) Average Accuracy / Perplexity (g) with LeOPArd Runtime Pruning) 2.37-2.37.37 G-QQP 91.2-1-1 G-COLA. 2-2-L 2-3 G-G-QNLI 2-4 G-WNLI 1-2 G-NLI. 2-1 B-2 B-<br/> They evaluate GPT-2 using perplexity, which favors a lower value of perplexity. They use perplexity to test the effectiveness of the GPT2 algorithm. They find that perplexity is derived from the perplexity model, which is based on the model of the language language. LeOPArd results in a 007 decrease in a decrease in the pruning results in 0.07% decrease in pruning. The GPT has a run-down rate of 0.0% with no effect on the algorithm.<br/> LeOPArd prunes 91.7% (max. 97.4%) of total Q√óKùëá ùëÜùëêùëìùëüùëís. The pruning-aware fine-tuning pass evenly improves accuracy for some of the benchmark tasks, with the maximum of 2.2%. The accuracy fluctuations are unavoidable due to randomness in deep learning training. They conjecture the lower pruning rates in BERT models are due to the higher probability of correlation between various tokens in the more complex language processing tasks.<br/> MemN2N with the bAbi dataset requires 4.5 bits, while BERT-B requires 8.3 and 8.0 bits with the GLUE dataset. The average number of bits in GPT-2-L and ViT attain 7.6 and 9.0. This devised early termination mechanism significantly reduces the computations of the Q √ó Kùëá.55.3-7.6 bits. On average across all tasks, AE-LeOPArd provides 1.9√ó and 2.4√ó speedup over the baseline, re-spectively. </p>

They attribute these improvements to the higher pruning rate and more bit-level termination oppor-tunities in this model‚Äôs tasks. The benefits are more pronounced for HP-LeopArd because it deploys more QK-DPUs which improves the performance of the Q-PUs.<br/> On average, LeOPArd reduces total energy consumption by 3.9√ó (3.9x) and 4.0x (4x) across all studied tasks. The energy reduction is the greatest for MemN2N-Task-1 (9.2x for AE-LeOPard and 9.6x for HP-LeopArd) and ViT-B achieves the lowest savings.

<p class="text"> Pro-pro-proposal fundamentally differs from prior seminal work. LeOPArd formulates threshold finding as a regularizer to methodically co-optimize with the weight parameters of the models, without approximation. This formulation strikes a formal and analytical balance between model accuracy and computation reduction. The application of the proposed mathematical formulation of identifying threshold values and its cohesive-integration into the training loss is broad and can potentially be adopted across a wide range of compute reduction techniques.
