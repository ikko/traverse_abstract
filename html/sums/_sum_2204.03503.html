<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep-Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers. They structure analysis of deep learning methods along three categories: word embeddings, sequential models, and attention-based methods. Deep learning impacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as they noticed that the learned representations alone do not contribute to the best results, but they rather show to work in a complementary way with hand-engineered features. They provide an outlook on research direction that can be addressed in the future. </p>

<p class="text"> Recent progress in Deep Learning and NLP facilitated the design and analysis of machine learning models for textual data. They provide a historical perspective with an overview of the changes and developments in the field over time. They pay attention to the role of text representations, i.e. features, their importance to effectively describe the characteristics of sentences and paragraphs, and the shift from hand-engineered to automatically learned features determined by the use of deep learning methods. They organize the works following a simple taxonomy that focuses on the type of text representation used. </p>
<p class="text"> The ASAG survey is structured in three parts. The first part covers important benchmark data sets for the evaluation of short answer grading (ASAG) algorithms (cf. Section 5). Each of the data sets has specific characteristics that allow to evaluate different aspects of ASAG systems related to their capabilities. ASAG is based on supervised learning and designed to support grading efficiency in educational settings. Unsupervised.approaches, such as ranking or clustering, were used to group together student answers. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers. They focus on reviewing supervised methods, which are largely deployed for ASAG, and provide more precise evaluations due to the use of labeled correct answers for training. The data sets include three sets of labels, which serve to train models on 2-,3and 5-way task problems. The main search terms that they used were ‘automatic grading system’, ‘automated assessment’ and ‘digital assessment of students’ </p>
<p class="text"> The SciEntsBank data set comprises student answers to questions collected as part of a standardized assessment in grades 3 to 6 in schools across North America. The Beetle data set only contains categories of unseen answers and unseen questions. In total, the data set contains 4969 answers to 135 questions from 12 domains. Average number of answers per question was 37.366,366.9% (in words) Average answer length was 1,721; maximum answer length is 110.80%. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers: from word embedding to Transformers. The University of North Texas data set (Texas2011) contains answers given by 30 students to 80 different questions, which result in approximately 2400 question-answer pairs. The data set has the purpose of mirroring real-world issues of the process of evaluating short answers as realistically as possible. This results in more complex and nested answer-structures, which also include the use of tables. </p>
<p class="text"> The categorization of methods is based on the machine learning approach and on the type of representation (features) used. For classical machine-learning approaches, the features are hand-engineered by domain experts, while in deep learning approaches the different types of representations are learned directly from the data. The main goal of these features is to describe key components (e.g. specific terms, concepts) of good answers by detecting specific patterns. They provide an overview of the reviewed methods in Table 2 and the results that they achieved on benchmark data in Table 3. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers. The authors found that the cosine coefficient contributed to obtaining the best performance on the estimation of sentence similarity. In, the authors compared three-word overlap computation methods: i) Dice coefficient, ii) Jaccard coefficient and iii) cosine.coefficient, and i) cosin coefficient, were compared and studied their impact on the performance of an ASAG system. SoftCardinality computes several similarity scores by considering different char-riddenacter q-grams. </p>
<p class="text"> The methods were developed by Stefan Haller, Adina Aldea, Christin Seifert, and Nicola Strisciuglio. ASAG is based on lexical, syntactic and semantic features used in combinations with machine learning classifiers. Table 2.1: The methods for ASAG are based on Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic features. The ASAG results were published in Vol. 1: No. 1, No. 10; Publication date: April 2022. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers, they report accuracy unless otherwise specified. They report accuracy of performance of the ASAG methods based on hand-engineered features listed in Table 2. Performance measures are reported in the same precision as in the original papers. The ASAG results are published in the journal ASAP, Vol. 1, No. 1. The ASAP-SAS findings will be published in May 2022. They provide an overview of the ASASASAS findings. </p>
<p class="text"> The deep learning developments in the ASAG field align with the methodological advances in the field of NLP. They organize the deep learning methods for ASAG in three categories. The first category contains methods based on word embedding models (e.g. Word2Vec) These models transform similar words into vectors that are close to each other in an embedded latent space, and generate sentence embeddings by either summing or combining them into words. No. 1 Article, Vol. 1, 1, published April 2022. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers. Deep learning methods for ASAG based on word embeddings encode semantically similar words to close points in a latent space. These methods were demonstrated successfulto improve the evaluation of word similarity, but did not clearly outperform previous methods for representation of entire sentences in ASAG systems. They elaborate on the details of the three categories of methods in the remainder of this section, addressing the benefits, drawbacks, and performance of learned text representations. </p>
<p class="text"> Stefan Haller, Adina Aldea, Christin Seifert, and Nicola Strisciuglio discuss deep learning methods for ASAG. The type of semantics that they learn from the text, and the focus of their architecture, are discussed in Table 4.1. The ASAG method is based on the type of language that it learns from text. Steifert and Aldea discuss how ASAG learn from text and how they learn the semantics of words. For example, the ASAG algorithm was based on a model called CNN, with CNN being combined with a random forest of words and sentences. </p>

<p class="text"> Previous works showed that ASAG systems perform well when word-embeddings and hand-engineered features are combined. The authors proposed a method that combines commonly used text representations with features that capture the diversity and style of formulation of the student answers. They achieved state-of-the-art results on the ASAP-SAS data set and demonstrated that Word2Vec embeddings, combined with quantification of text overlaps and keywords play a relevant role in the automatic grading of answers. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers: from word Embedding to Transformers. The results were based on a series of questions and answers that were answered by a student. The results are based on the scores and scores of students who have been trained to answer the questions using deep-learning algorithms. The data was created using an algorithm called a Deep Learning Machine Machine Learning tool called Deep Learning Learning Toolkit. The toolkit was created by deep-learned deep learning software to test students' knowledge of how to answer questions and answer questions.<br/> Latexit sha1_base_wallet_64="V6VRCjHBjHBGpcgpcgLRy5iHErX6Zw8ns=">A.

This indicates that the performance of ASAG tasks are the. performance of the underlying word-embedding models capture the semantic. properties of words and sentences. Thus, the use of models that integrate of the. use of the models that longer. longer. sequential. relations in textual. relations proved to enrich the semantic information of the textual input in textual input.<br/> Recent methods for ASAG explored more sophisticated feature representations, computed with attention-based and transformer models, to capture better and more descriptive semantic and structural characteristics from text. Attention enables the calculation of the relation and relative relative importance between each word within a sentence. The attention mechanism allows to model the dependency of words and their importance for the prediction task at a longer range in sentences. The modeling does not take into account the sequentiality of words explicitly. The attention mechanisms were introduced in, and are called. </p>
<p class="text"> The choice of the input embeddings and the correct fine-tuning of the pre-trained models on the task at hand is crucial to obtain good results. In, LSTMs and ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNNs) were combined with attention mechanisms, and they were demonstrated to outperform previous methods. Other methods were based on the use of transformer models Their success and high-performance results are attributable to the high parallelization of the computations, which allows the ability of modeling long-range dependencies. </p>
<p class="text"> The authors proposed a combined use of a CNN and a BiLSTM, together with an attention layer, which provides a refinement of the prediction before the output layer is computed. They hypothesize that these complex embeddings models are not able to effectively disentangle the semantically rich information contained in short answers. The performance of ASAGmethods has, however, not witnessed the same level of improvement. The best-performing methods, indeed, combine complex embeddeddings representation computed by combined. </p>

Figure 4.1 is a simplified version of the model proposed by the study's authors. 1: The model is a model of a model that has been used by students to test the accuracy of predictions. The models are aggregated at the prediction stage with hand-crafted features that are specific to address specific characteristics of each question.<br/> Currently, the research community of NLP and ASAGis investigating ways to optimize the embeddings of paragraphs of medium size which best repre-sent the semantic information contained in the student answers. Existing methods have difficulties to model the rich semantic content of short answers effectively. This is due to the fact that, usually, short answers are written in such a way that a lot of information is provided in few sentences and in a very concise way. Therefore, ASAG systems require methods for better and deeper contextual and semantic understanding of the answers. </p>
<p class="text"> Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: from Word Embeddings to Transformers. The application of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques should be investigated. The analysis of student answers presents several challenges related to the way sentences are formulated. Grading systems need to be able to take into account these cases and interpret or infer complete answers from fragments of sentences. The available benchmark data sets are rather sparse and are not representative enough of the variability of questions and short reference answers in different domains. </p>
<p class="text"> They reviewed the recent progress in the field of Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) and provided an overview of the advancements made and results achieved using deep learning tech-niques. They added to previous literature analyses by identifying the key features and architectural choices that impacted the performance of ASAG systems in the era of Deep Learning. Deep Learning architectures for natural language processing, adapted to ASAG tasks by means of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques, are not sufficient to deal with the challenges and requirements that this field presents. </p>
