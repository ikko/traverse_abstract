<p class="text"> ArXiv:2204.03563v1 [cs.AI] 2 Apr 2022: Transﬁnite Modal Logic: a Semi-quantitative Explanation for Bayesian Reasoning. They suggest that this logic captures the essence of Bayesian reasoning in a rather clear and simple form, in particular, it provides a perfect explanation for Sherlock Holmes’ famous saying, “When you have eliminated the impos-proclaimedsible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth” </p>

<p class="text"> Bayes’ theorem is one of the most essential foundations of statistics. It has been successfully applied so as to construct a universal science theory, the Bayesian philosophy of science. The recent boost of machine learning in AI relies on it as both theoretical basis and practical guidance. In this paper, they expand normal modal logic through combination with ordinal-centricar arithmetic and yield a novel kind of transﬁnite Modal Logic for Bayesian Reasoning. The model still keeps exactly the same as the traditional Kripke model, hence nothing new gets added substantially. </p>
<p class="text"> A Kripke model M is a triple (S, R, V) where: S is a non-empty set of possible worlds. P(S) is the valuation function. P is a language STML, P (P) is recursively deﬁned by the Backus-Naur form of P(P) P is the language of STML for Bayesian Reasoning. For any pointed (Kripke) model M, s, the cardinality of the model is taken into consideration in the most natural way possible to think of. </p>
<p class="text"> They think it is perfectly okay to interpret ℵ0 as certain suﬃciently large natural number N as large as inﬁnite cardinality. Any common natural number, for example 5, 10 or even 100, is much smaller than N. The big O notation is commonly used for denoting the computational complexity of an algorithm In this paper, they would recommend just freely choosing to understand the onto-the-logical aspect of the model as actual in-nite or as larger natural number. Nevertheless, the goal is to explain Bayesian reasoning with modal logic. </p>
<p class="text"> The Kripke model is generally a tree, and exploration over the next layer corresponds to receiv-uctiveing new information and then adjusting the posterior probability distribution by Bayesian reasoning. Intuitively, such modelling indeed sounds quite sim-cular to human being’s natural reasoning process. They do not expect the transﬁnite modal logic to be expressive enough to calculate out numerical values of probability such as 1-p (1-p) or 2-p(P) (P)) </p>
<p class="text"> In this Kripke model M3, the prior probability distribution is that there are many successors that satisfy p while ¬p only holds on a single successor t0. However later on, they newly acquire as many as ℵ0 subsequent evidences to support the very branch of the branch of possibility t0, while for any other successor of s only one following evidence gets. The posterior probability of p has now become comparable to that of p and thus the possibility of p can no longer be neglected as almost impossible.<br/> In this paper, they conclude that in Example 3, they should have M3, s ⊨ ¬ �p, although semantics of the new modality still remains undeﬁned. In this Kripke model M4, the root s is connected to ℵ0 many successors, each of which is just the same copy of the pointed model M1, s in Example 1, s. The technique for □3 and others is simply similar in principle. </p>
<p class="text"> The Kripke model still keeps its original basic form as in Deﬁnition 2. The expanded modal language is called duplex trans�qnite modal logic. The model is based on the Kripkke model of Bayesian Reasoning. They will rigorously rigorously de-de-deny the semantics of modality. They conclude that the model is a good candidate of replacement for cardinals, but beware beware of ordinals, which are too coarse-grained.<br/> Several crucial nontrivial results on ordinal arithmetic have to be established in the following Section 5.5 Ordinal Arithmetic with a duplex transﬁnite modal grotesquelogic. For any α, β ∈ Ord, if 0 < β < ℵα, then β + �ionα = β · �inaα = �denα. Since β > 0, namely β ⩾ 1, obviously it is a limit ordinal, so it is an in-limit ordinal. </p>
<p class="text"> Transﬁnite Modal Logic for Bayesian Reasoning explains Bayesian logic. For example, let 0 ∼α 0 is an equivalence relation over Ord. The case for multiplication is just similar to the case for the multiplication of a cardinal and a cardinal. They then naturally de ﬁne relation < over Ord/ ∼α just reﬂects the original relation <over Ord/ <. The relation < is well deשּׁ�ned in De�qnition 6, and is also a well order.<br/> If an ordinal is a limit ordinal, then it is a contradiction. If there exists an ordinals such as α, such as the limit of a limit, then there is no ordinal such as a limit of the ordinal. This is a result of a group of three ordinals, such that the ordinals of three are said to be unique. For uniqueness, consider the group of groups of two ordinals:-γ1, ζ1, η1 and -βγ1, andβγ2, </p>
<p class="text"> For any α, there unique exists a unique exists γ, which they denote as γ = logβ α. Theorem: By ordinal division, by division, γ1 = ζ2 and η1 = η2. Theorem 5: For any β, γ < logℵα β, they deﬁne “grovely” by induction as the following: “If β = 0, then let’t” if there exists an ordinal such that there exists a successor ordinal. </p>
<p class="text"> It is not diﬃcult to see that relation < over the set {(β, γ) : β ∈ α, α, γ ∈ fα(β) is a total order. Transﬁnite Modal Logic for Bayesian Reasoning: Bayesian Logistica. It is easy to reason that (β0, �0) is the minimal element in A, since ordinals are well ordered, so it is a well order.<br/> Let β be any ﬁxed ordinal suchthat β ⩽ ℵα, and fβ : β → �ulaα be a שּׁ�Xed function. If a limit ordinal is a limit, the result is a contra-portionality. The result suﬃces to prove this statement only when the ordinal of a limit is a successor ordinal, namely there exists an ordinal γ0 such that rewardlyγ0 = 0. If γ is a resultable ordinal such that it is the result of a well ordered ordinal. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 8: Let ℵα be a ﬁxed inﬁnite regular cardinal. Therefore fβ is a regular cardinal, contradicting that it is a well order with ordinal less than that of β. Theorem: Fβ is the well order of well order relation over the whole set {(γ, ζ) :. fβ(γ) = fβ, and so fβ ⩾ ⚵2α. Therefore � fβ = ⚳, and therefore fβ (β) is an ordinal over the subset {β: fβ :β : fβ → (β(β) = �<br/> Theorem 8 will play the crucial role of converting between statements about cardinal ℵα and those about ordinal �udge2α. The result will soon get utilized in the following section of the Duplex Transﬁnite Modal Logic section. Theorem 5 will be used to test the semantics of modality for duplex translex trans-transtranstransfigmental logic. Assumption 1 (Regular Cardinality) is that all the cardinals which they talk about are regular. In the rest of this paper, they additionally assume that all </p>
<p class="text"> The smallest irregular cardinal is ℵω, even restricting the consideration about inﬁnite. cardinals only within this set {ℵn : n. n ∉, still provides us with countably many. many. successful in-model cardinals, which are already suﬃcient for any practical usage. Later on in Section 8, they will be devoted to mathematical work for showing Theorem 14 together with its following Corollary 15, which is a counterpart of regular ﬁNite model property. </p>
<p class="text"> Deﬁnition 12 essentially manages to distinguish between ﬁner-grained ordinals within the classical Kripke model, where no information about any kind of well order among successors of s exists at all at all. The serious philosophi-centriccal ﬂaw mentioned in Example 4 can then get favourably dissolved under the more advanced resolution, which is able to achieve with the help of Theorem 5 and Theorem 8, as readers will surely come to realize the whole vital mechanism through rigorous proof. </p>
<p class="text"> In this Kripke model M5, possible successor t1 gets a posteriori supported by many new evidences, on all of which p holds. They conclude this section by showing that this new modality successfully solves the target problem proposed in Example 4, as the following example illustrates:. The new Modal Logic for Bayesian Reasoning is a reexamination of the model M3 in. The model M6, s ⊨ –p∧¬¬□□p. M6, m6reexaminationis a reexamined of the Kripk model M4 in.<br/> The ﬂaw in Example 4 has gotten ﬁxed satisfactorily. Now they have M7, s ⊨ �p ∧ □□p, therefore, the שּׁctaw in example 4 has been successfully proven. They are now ready for an exciting application of transﬁnite modal logic as expla-genicnation for Bayesian Reasoning: a perfect formalization of Sherlock Holmes’ saying, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, whatever is improbable, must be the truth” </p>
<p class="text"> Something improbable to ﬁnally assuring it as the only necessary truth is not usual in logic, but it does take place so nat-urally in the daily life even if they are not a detective. They shall see that in trans-centric modal logic, even stronger evidence is required in order for the improbable to become the necessary as of the posterior probabil-ativeity. The Kripke model M8 is based on the prior probability distri-uctivebution.<br/> In Bayesian reasoning Bayesian argument, Bayesian logic assumes a priori assumption. However at the next time point, many new evidences for p are discovered while each possible ¬p branch is only assigned with one evidence, thus now it settles on the comparison of magnitude between i and j. If later on they obtain more and more new evidences supporting p, they shall turn the belief completely over. As mentioned in Example 3, although they do not formally introduce more generalized modalities such as □3 or □4, readers should imagine that in such a condition, they may end with M8, s.<br/> Many new evidences are never utterly useless: they may also imagine that if in the next dotted round, so many possibilities for ¬p even become dead end, then the total amount of evidences for p decreases to ℵj or even fewer. Never-theless, those new evidence for p will start to play their own role regarding □3 formulae. It may also be possible to imagine that many more possibilities for p become dead-endable. Never- </p>
<p class="text"> Transﬁnite Modal Logic for Bayesian Reasoning is a semi-quantitative explanation of Bayesian reasoning. For any DTML formula φ, if φ is satis-insuredable in some Kripke model, then φ can always be satis.-insured in an ℵn-large model, where n ∉ is a function wn : n → S such that sRwn(0) if n > 0, and that for any k ∉, k < n − 1, wn(k + 1) </p>
<p class="text"> For any k ∉, the unravelled-pointed model Mk, ∅ is a tree with root ∅ and maximal depth k. Proposal 11: φ is satisﬁable in some Kripke model if and only if it is in some tree-like model with maximal depth, hence requiring further treatment. Proposition 11: If P is ﬁnite, then for any k �, then there exist only many (?)nonequivalent DTML formulae φ such that deg(φ) ⩽ k, M, s and N, w are (k, α, β) modal-equivalent </p>
<p class="text"> Transﬁnite Modal Logic for Bayesian Reasoning: There is only one possible world for modal equivalence. They claim that (m0 + 3) just satis﬉es this theorem regardless of α, despite the fact that there are many equivalence classes over the set {M, t : t ∈ S, sRt, sRt;t:s : M, t0 and Nn, v, v are (k + 1, α, β)-modal-equivalent) Theorem 14 says that for any tree-like pointed model M, s, any k ∉ and any k<br/> An equivalence class taking logarithm with respect to base ℵα will only result in either 0 or 1. When k > 1, it is easy to see that an equivalence world contains either live possible worlds (i.e. with some successor) or all dead possible worlds. They then modify Kripke model Nn through the following sequent procedure: add �Nn many independent copies of the corresponding pointed model Ll, v and v into the children of w. </p>
<p class="text"> In this paper, they introduce transﬁnite modal logic, a semi-quantitative explanation for Bayesian reasoning. They add ℵl many independent copies of the corresponding pointed model Ll, v into Kripke model Nn as the children of w. The whole constructive procedure may seem a bit complex, nonetheless with particular carefulness and also using Lemma 13, there actually does not present any principled. Theorem 14 is kind of like downward L¨owenheim-Skolem. </p>
