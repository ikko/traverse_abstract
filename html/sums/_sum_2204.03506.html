<p class="text"> QCRI’s COVID-19 Disinformation Detector: Truly a System to Fight the COVI-19 Infodemic in Social Media. An API, 1, and a demo system,2 which they made freely-available, is publicly available. They believe that this will facilitate researchers and different stake-held stake-holders. The interplay between such diverse sets of information is unprecedented and requires a holistic approach that can facilitate journalists, fact-checkers, policymakers, social me-hostia platforms, and society. </p>

<p class="text"> In this paper, they describe COVID-19 Info-ipientdemic system – API services. API services can assist both technical and non-technical end users. Such services will be helpful to understand whether the information is correct, harmful, calling for action to be taken by relevant authorities, etc. Such services have already been used in the in-house data analysis pipeline and by an external website. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2 offers a brief overview of previous work. Section 3 provides a detail of the system. Section 4 discusses possible use cases and points to possible directions for future work. </p>
<p class="text"> The annotated dataset consists of a total of 4,966 tweets for Arabic, French, Dutch, Arabic, Dutch and English. It also has ﬁve. two labels: (i) NO, deﬁnitely contains no. no. false information, (ii) Not sure, (IV) YES, probably not of interest, (iii) Not Sure, (iv) YES or "probably" probably contains false information. Harmful to society: Is the tweet harmful to society, person(s), company(s) or product(s). They then preprocess the data, which includes removal of hash-symbols.<br/> Table 2 shows the performance of the classiﬁers for all languages: both in binary and in multiclass settings. All results are higher than the majority baseline, except for a few cases where the class label distribution is very skewed (e.g., for Bulgarian, Q7 with binary labels). The results in the binary settings are higher. The performance in terms of a weighted average, which takes into account class-imbalance issue. The API services provide the functionality to pro-activelycess and classify language-speci﬉c tweets by spec-uallyifying the desired language. </p>
<p class="text"> Arabic, Bulgarian and Dutch English annotated tweets for COVID-19 infodamic search engine. Number of annotated questions per language and per question. Performance of the models for the models for the models. They provide the number of classes for the question, and task (i.e., binary or multiclass) as well as the type of question. In addition, they provide the con-sists of the labels for each question and the probability scores if needed.<br/> An option to select a language enables to direct the demo to process language-speciﬁc content. The Tweet Analytics part, as shown in Figure 4b, is to visualize aggregated statistics over time to understand whether certain phenom-like tweets are increasing or decreasing. They also provide relevant API client-client-scripts publicly to facilitate users. The demo interface has two parts: tweet classi-centric and tweet analytics. The tweet analytics part allows the user to show classi.-centric results as a summary and individual plots to visualize the class-specognitiveprobabilities. </p>
<p class="text"> They have presented a system to ﬁght the global COVID-19 infodemic. They provide API services, which support fthe different languages, for the com-uvemunity and non-technical end-users. The API services can be used in different appli-centric scenarios. For example, analyzing tweets with trending topics, which might be speciﬁc to any event. Finding content that can spread panic or rumors, or false claims, so that they can be easily debunked. </p>
