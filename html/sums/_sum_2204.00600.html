<h3>Traversability, Reconfiguration, and Reachability in the Gadget Framework</h3>

<p class="text"> An agent traverses a graph of ‘gadgets’, each with local state that changes with each traversal by the agent. They characterize the complexity of universal traversal, where the goal is to traverse every gadget at least once, for DAG gadgets, one-state gadgets, and re-versible deterministic gadgets. They also study the. complexity of reconﬁguration, where. the goal.is to bring the system of gadgets to a speci-ridden state, proving many cases PSPACE-complete. They show a gadget with non-interacting tunnels whose.re-guicon-guration problem is PSPACE.complete, but whose reach </p>

<p class="text"> The gadgets framework has already been used to prove complexity results about reconﬁguration problems related to swarm and modular robotics They also extend the results in to show a larger class of gadgets which are in NP and describe a sub-class of those in P. They show that for reversible, deterministic gadgets PSPACE-completeness of the reachability problem im-ishlyplies PSPACE’s PSPACE Completeness. In contrast, they exhibit a gadget forwhich the recon-guration problem becomes easier. </p>
<p class="text"> They provide a full characterization for the complexity of this problem for three classes of gad-ishlygets. In Section 3.1, they characterize DAG k-tunnel gadgets. Reachability is always in NL for one-state gadgets, but they ﬁnd that universal traversal is often NP-complete. By Savitch’s. theorem universal. traversal for any gadget is in PSPACE. They can easily solve the universal travers. problem in nondeterministic polynomial space: Repeatedly guess the next traversal. </p>
<p class="text"> They use the fact that every nontrivial DAG gadget simulates either a directed or an undi-rected single-use path. From any state in G, there is only one tunnel which can ever be traversable. Universal traversal for any true 2-tunnel DAG gadgets is NP-complete. They leave ambiguous exactly what ‘equivalent’ means, since what counts as equivalent should not necessarily be different for different victory conditions. They modify the system of gadgets in an instance of the reachability problem by adding a construction to each gadget which allows the agent to go back and make a traversal after reaching the win location.<br/> It can open tunnels in the added gadgets, traverse the (top) gadget the construction is attached to, and return. It can instead use a traversal in each added gadget without visiting that gadget. If the agent already used the gadget this is used to, it can use it to find a way to reach the win location of a given gadget. The agent can now find a tunnel in each gadget and return to the original location of the gadget it's attached to. It is possible </p>
<p class="text"> Two cases for the form of the gadget in Lemma 3.7, assuming traversing the top tunnelto the right opens the bottom tunnel to the right. Unlabled transitions may be to arbitrary states not speciﬁed here. If only one tunnel is not traversable in this state, then it cannot be true 2-tunnel because the other tunnel will never become a new state. Figure 3a: The construction to allow the agent to use a gadget after reaching the win location, when the bottom. tunnel is traversable from right to left in state S. </p>
<p class="text"> Lemma 3.8.8: A Hamiltonian path in a directed 3-regular graph is Hamiltonian. The agent must use the single-use directed path in each of the gadgets in state S for the in-degree 2 vertices. If no transition from S across one tunnel opens a traversal across the other, then universal traversal for G is NP-hard. If there is no distant opening and all all tunnels are undirected, the problem is solvable. </p>
<p class="text"> The form of state S is shown in Figure 7. They reduce from a Hamiltonian path in a directed 3-regular graph with speciﬁed start and end vertices s and t, similarly to Lemma 3.8.8. They replace each other with the appropriate half of one of these gadgets. If there is a path, the agent can follow it to make a traversal in every gadget. The agent must always enter a vertice on one of the in-edges and exit on an out-edge. </p>
<p class="text"> Lemma 3.10.10: They reduce from a Hamiltonian path in an undirected 3-regular graph with speciﬁed start and end vertices s and t. Each of the nine gadgets is in state S and the tunnels a and b can both be traversed in both directions in S. Traversing a vertice in this way goes through every gadget in S, so since the path is Hamiltonian the agent uses all of these gadgets. Since the path ends at t, it also uses the single-use path to t. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 3.6: universal traversal for any true 2-tunnel DAG gadget is NP-complete. The problem is solvable if and only if a Hamiltonian path exists. The agent must go through each gadget exactly once, starts at s, and must end at s. The agent can make a bounded number of traversals in each gadget, and thus the problem is in NP-hardness. They consider ways it can't use the path it enters and leaves on different paths; there are three gadgets it uses both tunnels on.<br/> The gadgets considered in Lemmas 3.7 and 3.9 all have NP-hard reachability as well as universal traversal. But those considered in 3.8 or 3.10 do not necessarily have reachability. For example, for the gadget shown in Figure 10, for example, reachability is in NL since there are not interacting tunnels. The proofs of Lemmas are based on reductions from Hamil-giannian paths in planar graphs, which shows the universal </p>
<p class="text"> Problem 3.11: Is universal traversal restricted to planar systems of gadgets NP-hard for all true 2-tunnel DAG gadgets? Theorem 3.2: Universal traversal with any one-state gadget with no directed tunnel is in L. The problem is clearly in NL for such gadgets, but they will see that universal. traversal is of-ten NP-complete for those gadgets with only one state. The full solution path can be described in polynomial space. </p>
<p class="text"> Universal traversal with any one-state k-tunnel gadget with a directed tunnel is NL-hard. They reduce from s-t connectivity in directed graphs to NL-complete They will use only one directed tunnel in each gadget. This algorithm can clearly run in logarithmic space. Since all tunnels are undirected, the agent can visit each gadget in turn and return to the start location after each one. They then adapt it to an LNL algorithm which is known to equal NL </p>
<p class="text"> An NL algorithm solves universal traversal with any one-state k-tunnel gadget with a directed edge is NP-hard. They run the algorithm in nondeterministic logarithmic space as follows. The agent can traverse the tunnels in T in the order described by ≚. This is a solution to the problem. They use NL algorithms to test whether the algorithm is correct when they read a bit of the input to determine whether a clause is in the formula. If they guess it does exist, they run a coNL algorithm to verify that there is no path from the exit of x to the entrance of y or vice versa. </p>
<p class="text"> They prove Theorem 3.12 characterizing the complexity of universal traversal for one-state k-tunnel gadgets. They show that for reversible reversible gadgets they can solve the reachability question for each usable location of the gadget. The algorithm works because the agent can follow the path to a gadget, use that gadget, and then reverse its path back to the initial conﬁguration. They also add a gadget at the target where it is usable if and only if the agent reaches the target location. This can clearly be done in polynomial time. </p>
<p class="text"> For any reversible gadget the reachability problem being PSPACE-complete implies the reconﬁguration problem is also PSPACE. They show that for any reversible gadgets the reachabil-glybounded reachability problems are always in NP. They also exhibit a re-versible, deterministic gadget with non-interacting tunnels for which the reconghuration problem can be PSPACE.completeness Theorem 4.1.1 shows that a cooperative, multi-agent-agent problem is always PSPACE.-complemented. </p>
<p class="text"> A regular 1-toggle can be easily constructed from the non-interacting box gadget by taking a single-tunnel in a leaf state. They then show how they can augment that construction to allow a single agent to replicate the actions of all of the others in the multi-agent construction. The construction will only work as intended if there are three or fewer agents adjacent to the gadget. They will build a gadget that does not allow individual agents through the gadget at all, but if it has an agent on either side of it, a third agent can use the gadget as though it were a 1toggle. </p>
<p class="text"> The multi-agent 1-toggle will be comprised of one non-uveinteracting box gadget, fthe multi-agents 1-toggles, and six helper agents. The gadgets will only be used in a way that this condition remains satisﬁed. They argue that the only ways agents can move through this gadget are equivalent to the intended usage of the multi agent one-toggle. The multi agent locking 2Toggle is comprised of a non-veil acting box gadget and fthe helper agents. It will allow an addi-agogue17 that can be used at any point in time; however, these gadgets will be used only in this way. </p>
<p class="text"> The canonical unlocked state is shown in Figure 13 with the non-interacting box gadget in the lower left state, the 1-toggles pointing right and down, and the internal agents in the left and top sides respectively. The internal helper agents will only be able to shift the state of the gadget over once, ensuring that they cannot move the gadget outside of the bottom or right square states. This is the property that ensures only one agent can cross the path of a gadget along the incorrect pathway while it is locked. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 4.2.2: Constructing a gadget that behaves well when used like a hard gadget, but might also have other transitions which put the gadget into some undesirable state. In this section they will discuss a technique for generating hard gadgets. The main idea is to create a shadow gadget of the base gadget with the restriction that all newly added gadgets must take the gadget to a shadow state. This has the nice property that if the. gadget takes any transition that would not be allowed in the base. gadget, the gadget will always stay in a shadow. state after that point. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 4.2: Reconﬁguration motion planning is PSPACE-complete for some gadgets which never change their traversability. They simply take the hard instance for the problem with the base gadget and replace it with a shadow gadget. If a solution exists in the initial instance, it will still be a solution with the shadow gadgets. If the agent ever tries to take a transition in a. shadow gadget that would not have been. been allowed in the original instance, that gadget will now be in a shadow state. Theorem: Reachability motion planning with a veri ﬁed gadget is at least as hard as reachability motion </p>
<p class="text"> In DAG gadgets were studied as a naturally bounded class of gadgets and a broader notion of DAG was instigated in They call a gadget F-DAG-like if its state graph can be decomposed into disjoint subgraphs. They then show that if F is a family of gadgets for which the reconﬁguration and reachability problems for F and for NReAG gadgets are also in NP. They give the following certiative proof of the solution to NPReDAG gadgets. </p>
<p class="text"> Reachability motion planning is in NP for gadgets where reconﬁguration motion planning purposefullyis in NP. Figure 14 shows the Labeled Two-Tunnel-Single-Use gadget. It is a DAG gadget where going through either tunnel of the gadget closes both of them; however, the states are distinguished based on which tunnel was traversed. In this case, the labeling of the state tells us which of the two tunnels must have been traversed to reach that state. </p>
