<p class="text"> Su Feng, Boris Glavic, Aaron Huber, Oliver Kennedy, and Atri Rudra. They study the problem of computing a tuple’s expected multiplicity over probabilistic databases with bag semanan-centrictics. They are speciﬁcally interested in the complexity of computing expected multiplicities and how it compares to complexity of deterministic query evaluation algorithms. They develop a sampling-algorithm that computes a (1 ± 휖)-approximation of the expected result tuples in time linear in the runtime of the.response query for any RA+ query. They proceed to study approxi-oglemation of expected<br/> This work explores the problem of computing the expectation of the multiplicity of a tuples in the result of a query over a 푐-TIDB. It is a type of probabilistic database with bag semantics where the mul-partisantiplicity of tuples is a random variable with range [0,�A] for some certain constant, and multiplicities assigned to any two tuples are in-dependent of each other. An RA+ query is a query expressed in positive relational algebra, i.e., using only the relational algebra operators selection (휎), projection (%), natural join (�) and union </p>

<p class="text"> This paper considers the hardness of computing expectation using ﬁne-grained analysis and parameterized complexity. They ask if Problem 1.1 can be solved in time linear in the runtime of an analogous deterministic query. If this is true, then this would open up the way for deployment of 푐-TIDBs in practice. The paper considers RA+ queries for queries for order of queries, as opposed to other languages, eg.Datalog, UCQ.<br/> They introduce a (1±휖)-approximation-algorithm that computes Problem 1.1 in time in time linear in size of the deterministic query and bagPDBs are deployable in practice. The lower bound in the third row says that one cannot get more than a polynomial improvement over essentially the triv-centricial algorithm for Problem 1. The algorithm works for a more general notion of bag PDB beyond 푇-IDBs (see Sec.2).<br/> The bag semantics analog is a provenance/historic lineage polynomial with non-zero integer coeﬃcients and exponents. They now specify the problem of computing the expectation of tuples' multiplicity in the language of lineage Polynomials: "Expected Multiplicity of Lineage Polynomi-Polynomi" Problem 1.1 is equivalent (yields the same result as) to computing Problem 2.2 (see Proposition 2.8) Problems 1.2 and 1.3 follow from known results for counting cliques. </p>

This is illustratedin the following example using 푄22.1 from earlier. To aid in presenta-tion they assume is 2 for variable and for all other variables. Let let say “푝퐴 denote [�<br/> In computing �Φ, they have some cancella-hetical-tions to deal with:. In computing. In computing they use the term 'p' instead of p for X, they use p for p, p, and p for P, p. They then use p to create a pand pfor p. The p-word is p. Pis p. It is p. and p is p, which is the pword for p. It is a word for a word.<br/> An arithmetic circuit is a DAG with variable and/or numeric source nodes and inter-nal, each nodes representing either an addition or multiplication operator. Recent work in heuristic data cleaning emits a PDB when insuﬃcient data exists to select the ‘correct’ PDB. In sec. 4 they demonstrate that a (1 ±휖) (multimpositive) approximation with competitive per-formance is achievable. To get an (1±±millennial)-multiplicative approxima-vantition and solve Problem 1.6, using C they uniformly sample monomi-criptals from the equivalent SMB representation of. </p>
<p class="text"> PDB queries are impractically slow, even in approximation (see Appendix G) Probabilistic data cleaning is a crucial innovation, as the alternative is to arbitrarily select one repair and ‘hope’ that it will receive meaningful results. Bag-PDBs can be competitive, laying the groundwork for probabilistic functionality in production database engines. Bags, as they consider, are suﬃcient for production use, where bag-relational algebra is already the default for performance reasons.<br/> A polynomial �’ (X) is in standard mono-centricmial basis (SMB) when they keep only the terms with 푐d ≠ 0 from Eq. (1) They consider all polynomials to be in SMB representation. The degree of a polynomic polynomorphism is the largest number of joins needed to produce a result tuples. They deﬁne next a construction of a Binary-Binary-BIDB that is useful for the work.<br/> Figure 7 shows the lineage construction of a Binary-BIDB given RA+ query for arbitrary deterministic 퐷′. The probability distribution P′ is the probability distribution across all worlds such that, given a random variable, P′. They slightly abuse notation here, denoting a world vector as 푊 rather than W to differentiate between the random variable and the world instance. When there is no such ambiguity, they will denote a world-lessed world vector W. </p>

Queries over probabilistic databases are traditionally viewed as being evaluated using the so-called possible world semantics. The result of a query is the pair (푄 (Ω), P′) where P′ is a probability distribution that assigns to each possible result the sum of the probabilites of the worlds that produce this answer. The all-anonymous world set can be modeled by W ∈ {0, 1}푛푐, such that W푡, 푗, W.<br/> Problem 1.6 asks if there exists a linear time approximation al-gorithm in the size of a given circuit C which encodes a polynomial.

<p class="text"> The Expected Result Multiplicity Problem is deﬁned as follows: C ∈ CSet (Φ (X) for the element C, poly (C) = ω (X), poly(C) is always the equivalent SMB representa-tation. They require only that the algorithm must enumerate its output that must enumerate a set of tuples in the form of an algorithm for computing the 푚-ary join. They are now ready to formally state the ﬁnal version of Problem 1.6.12.<br/> Worst-case optimal join algorithms and query evalua-tion via factorized databases can be modeled as RA+ queries. They model index scans by treating an index scan query as a base relation. They assume that full table scans are used for every base relation access.

The hardness result in Section 3.3 is based on the following con-jectured hardness result:. The hard polynomial for the problem will be a suitable power 3 of the polynomancy above.<br/> Theorem 3.6 needs one to be able to compute the expected multiplicities over (2푘 + 1) distinct val-riddenues of 푖, each of which corresponds to distinct P (for the same value), which explain the ‘Multiple’ entry in the second column in the 'Multiple' entry.

<p class="text"> For a circuit C, they deﬁne E(C) as a list of tuples (v, c), where v is a set of variables and c ∈ N. For any circuit, the corresponding positive (C) circuit, denoted |C|, is obtained from C as follows. For each leaf node, update ℓ.value to |ℓ. The functions size (·), depth (·) and the number of gates and levels respectively for input C are used in the algorithm SampleMonomial.<br/> They solve Problem 1.6 for any ﬁxed 휖 > 0 in what follows. The approximation algorithm (Approximate�Φpseudo code) is based on the following observa-ationallytion. They sample (via SampleMonomial) (v, c) and compute Y = 1 isInd(vm) The algorithm is a sampling based algorithm. It is based upon the following Observa-heticaltion. The algorithm uses the following runtime for the algorithm outlined above:<br/> The restriction on 훾 is satisﬁed by any 1-TIDB (where 푝0 > 0 > 횾 < 1 is absolute constants) If 큝0 is 0 and and Â0 > are absolute constants then the above is the result of the algorithm out-line. The size comes from the time taken to run OnePass once it takes to run the OnePass one. </p>
<p class="text"> OnePass essentially computes |C| (1,... 1) using the natural cir-cuit evaluation algorithm on C. They address the M (log (|C|) (1), log (size(C)) term (C) term) in the runtime. For any Binary-BIDB circuit C with deg(C), they have a term that answers Problem 1.6 with yes for such circuits. Theorem 4.7 implies that with the assumption 푝0 > 0 and 훾 < 1 are absolute constants from Theorem.<br/> Probabilistic Databases (PDBs) have been studied predominantly for set semantics. This paper focuses on intensional query evaluation with polynomials. The algorithm is based on sampling (e-g., e-samples, OBDDs) and polynoms. It has been shown that computing the marginal probabilistic (or grounded) query evaluation of a tuples is #P-hard The second category is in extensional query evaluation, but is limited to certain classes of queries.<br/> They show that computing the expected multiplicities exactly is not possible in time linear in the corresponding deterministic query processing time. They prove that it is possible to approximate the expectation-likelihoodof a lineage polynomial in linear time. Interesting directions for future work include devel-opment of a dichotomy for bag PDBs. They thank Virginia Williams for showing us Eq.

<p class="text"> In the deﬁnition of TIDBs, they assumed inputs to be sets, but interpret queries under bag semantics. They can use K-relations to model bags. They assign each input tuples a multiplicity 푚푡 and probability 홙�: the tuples have probability exists with multiplicity 1. They note that the lower bounds still hold for this model since they only need 횚홉 for all tuples magnitude1.<br/> A probabilistic N-database (N-PDB) is a PDB where each possible world is an N-Database. A K-database is deﬁned similarly, where they view the K-Database (relation) as a function mapping tuples to their respective annotations. RA+ query semantics over K-relations are analogous to lineage construction semantics of RA+ queries. They study the problem of computing (RA+)statistical moments) for query results over such databases. </p>
<p class="text"> A representation system for N-PDBs is a tuple (M,푀표), where M is a set of representations. They say that a representation system is closed under a class of queries Q if for any query they have:.

The probability of each world is the product of the probabilities of all tuples that exist with one minus the probability </p>
<p class="text"> In this work, they deﬁne TIDBs and BIDBs as subclasses of N[X]encoded PDBs. They use bag semantics for queries. Even though tuples cannot occur more than once in the input TIDB or BIDB, they can occur with a multiplicity larger than one in the result of a query. They can interpret a vector w as denoting which tuples exist in the possible world where 휓w(DN[X) is 1.<br/> They need to prove for N-PDB D = (Ω, P) and N[X] Encoded PDB DN [X] = (퐷′ N[X], P′) where 푀표푑(DN[X) = D.

By inductive hypothesis it is the case that some valid monomials are being randomly sampled.<br/> When C.type = +, SampleMonomial will sample v from one of its inputs. By inductive hypothesis they know that any vL in E(CL) and vR in CR will both be sampled with correct probability. The probability of choosing CL from C is computed by OnePass. Each sampling choice is independent, and each choice is dependent on whether CL or CR is sampled. The algorithm returns the correct sign value of c by inductive hyptothesis. It is easy to check that except for lines 3 and 10, all lines take time.<br/> They can implement this step by picking a random number 푟 and then checking if it is true. They need to add and compare log |C| (1,... (1) to log (log (|C(1)(1.., 1) and log size(C) This is easy to check that 펎+푏 is true and they need to use log (C) to compare |C) and size ( </p>
<p class="text"> Cost (C) (Eq. (35) is an upper bound of the number of gates visited by SampleMonomial. The runtime is 푂 apologeticprovesthe claimed runtime. Cost (·) is a function that models an upperbound on the gates that can be visited in the run. They prove the following inequality holds. It is also true that an inequality whose operands consist of a sum of the aforemen-described inequalities must also hold.<br/> If C.type = ×, then, by substituting values, the following should hold, by eq. (35), substituting. (36) for the × case. Otherwise it is always true that depth(C) = max (depth(CL), depth(CR) + 1) In either case it is true that C. type = × and deg(C), depth() = deg(CL) + deg(CR), deg(CC) + (CR) is true. Eq. (40) is the result of E. (39) which holds for the following reasons. </p>
<p class="text"> Theorem 4.7, 훾 must be a constant in order for Algorithm 1 to acheive linear time. They would like to determine experimentally whether queries over BIDB instances in practice generate a constant number of cancellations or not. They ran experiments using Windows 10 WSL Operating System with an Intel Core i7 2.40GHz processor and 16GB RAM. Only one of the three queries had tuples that violated the BidB constraint. The experiments show 횾 to be in a range between [0, 0.1]% and a negligible or constant.<br/> They now formalize circuits and the construction of circuits for RA+ queries. They expect Theorem 4.7 to hold in general. They represent lineage polynomials as arithmetic circuits over N-valued variables with +, ×. A circuit for query and N[X]encoded PDB DN[X]. is a directed acyclic graph with vertices and directed edges. They require that 휙푄,DN[X’s range be limited to sink vertices (i.e., vertices with out-degree 0) </p>
<p class="text"> They require that vertices have an in-degree of at most two. The size of a circuit is asymptotically no worse than the corresponding runtime of a large class of deterministic query-processing algorithms. They can construct circuits for BIDBs in time linear in the time required for query processing over a possible world of the BIDB under the assumption that PDB DN[X] is bounding database with bounded multiplicities. There are |푉푄1,DN[X], �’큉턄, DN’X, and a fan-in-two tree is required.<br/> The depth of the circuit (depth; Deﬁnition 4.3) is bounded by the size of the query. They show that the bound of Proposition E.1 holds for the circuit constructed by Algorithm 4.1. For the join case, the number of in-edges can be no greater than the join width. The depth increase for any projection node is thus at most ⌉log(푛푘)⌉ = 푂(홄| log(큛)<br/> The base case is a base relation: 푄 = and is trivially true since |푉푅,DN[X] | = | and they implicitly exclude implicitlyin the proof below. The inductive step is the inductive assumption that they have circuits for subqueries such as maintainingthe degree that istripletrue. For clarity, they implicitly excludes inductivesubqueriesfor the induction. </p>

<p class="text"> The current state of the art approximation algorithm for this problem is the Karp-Luby estimator, which ﬁrst appeared in MayBMS/Sprout, and more recently as part of an online “anytime” approximation algorithm. The estimator works by observing that for any ℓ random binary binary (but not necessarily independent) events W1,... Wℓ is employed on the SMB representation19 of C (to solve the set-PDB version of Problem 1.6), where each event that one monomial is true is true.<br/> Conjecture 3.3 is based on the popular Triangle detection hypothesis in this area of complexity theory. By contrast note that by the discussion after Lemma 4.9 they can solve Problem 1.6 in time 푂 �|C|2.2� for all BIDB circuits independent of the degree HPARAMETERIZED COMPLEXITY.
