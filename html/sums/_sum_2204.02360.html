Data-driven decision making techniques have witnessed rapid evolutionaryevolution in the wind industry for such tasks during the last decade.

<p class="text"> Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied for decision making to learn from Super-visory Control & Acquisition (SCADA) data regularly generated by turbines through various sensors. The wind industry has not benefited as much from recent advances in AI, especially in deep learning. The multitude of directions in applying AI techniques make comprehensive analysis of AI integral for the wind-power industry. Most existing studies evidently focus on time-series forecasting of vital parameters in data-driven decision making, rather than predicting incipient faults.<br/> For analysis speciﬁc to science literature, the sub-departments of Bibliometrics have gained prominence. Few studies perform scientometric assessment of the wind energy domain as a whole. The domain of O&M for the wind industry is highly complex, with widely varying methodologies, data utilised and tasks performed. This is enunciated in Figure 1, through network visualisation of data-driven decision making publications over the last decade. They aim to provide comprehensive evaluation of the applications of AI for datadriven decision making. </p>
<p class="text"> An extensive analysis of the past and present of AI in data-driven decision making for wind turbines. They review 422 research publications in this domain from the last decade. They show the role which AI plays at present, and the rapidly evolving growth in application of AI techniques for O&M. They also provide a perspective into the future, including key issues such as lack of transparency and interpretability in AI models, deployment of models for real-time decision support, and data availability and quality.<br/> They will direct the discussion and analysis of the past mainly on CBM for a comprehensive analysis, but where relevant, they would also include the few studies which focused on performance assessment/analysis. They would also mention few notable studies outside this period in the reviews which are relevant to the scope of this paper. For the sake of thoroughness in analysing the past, for example, they will also mention some notable studies out of the period in this period. They will also include some of the notable studies which were relevant to this study. </p>
<p class="text"> Figure 2 outlines the frequency of the most common words in CBM-based publications during this period of analysis. Vibration analysis has been popular for fault diagnosis in turbine structures and sub-components, especially in the turbine structures. Frequency of top-50 words in the CBM publications for wind turbines in the past. They will discuss the prevalence of signal processing and vibration analysis for the use of CBM. They also highlight the most relevant papers from CBM papers in this period. </p>
<p class="text"> Multiple studies have utilised vibration signals and applied Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for detecting incipient faults in the turbine’s mechanical and electrical sub-components. The technique can help in identifying random wind vibrations and its eﬀects based on the analysed spectrum, facilitating fault diagnosis. Some variations in this technique have also been applied for short-term forecasting of wind speed, wind power etc. Some studies have applied wavelet transform for CBM by analysing vibration signals in the frequency domain.<br/> Figure 3 depicts the treemap tracing the hierarchical composition of signal processing and vibration analysis methods used in the past. It shows that empirical mode decomposition has been utilised in predicting faults, forecasting power output and designing turbine control systems. Spectral kurtosis, as well as wavelet transform, is another prevalent method associated with modelling vibration signals for turbine sub-components, especially the gearbox. Demodulation techniques have been commonly applied during signal processing of the vibration signals in the vibration. </p>
<p class="text"> A few studies have demonstrated promising results in applying conventional AI techniques prevalent in the past for performance assessment and analysis of turbines. For damage detection of turbine sub-components, as evident, the task has been performed with the angles of fault prediction, optimisation of operations and prevention of friction etc. Figure 4 provides a more-ne-grained view of the clusters of prevalent techniques and their common applications. Clifton et al. utilised aerostructural simulations data and applied regression trees to forecast turbine power output. </p>

Words relevant to the use of CBM are highlighted. Figure 8 of 49 words relevant to use in the analysis of AI techniques are highlighted by the frequency of top 50 words used by CBM in publications.

<p class="text"> The wind industry has seen a rapid growth in applications of Machine Learning (ML) models for data-driven decision support. Data-driven techniques, wherein, historical SCADA data is utilised to train AI algorithms, are often cheaper as well as simpler to use The signiﬁcant interest in AI for CBM can clearly be inferred. The rise of AI algorithms (in-cluding neural networks) is clearly outlined. The rise and fall of AI in the wind industry can be inferred. </p>
<p class="text"> In 2017, wind industry experienced an AI winter, with a signiﬁcantly reduced interest in applying AI for O&M. In between 2015 to 2020, AItechniques have been utilised in a variety of aspects, for which the thematic evolution is depicted in Figure 8. In the later half of this period (post 2017), they can observe the rise of deep learning, especially feedforward neural networks towards regression (e.g. predicting turbine power output time-seriesand short-term prediction of wind speed) </p>
<p class="text"> The simplest form of ML algorithms which have been utilised in the wind energy sector span the family of regression techniques. The time-varying nature of the SCADA data makes it extremely suitable for applying regression techniques in a supervised learning environment for predicting target values, such as power output, wind speed, wind direction etc. in new, unseen data. While signal processing techniques have dominated CBM and performance assessment of turbines, there have been early applications of conventional ML techniques which are worthy of mention. </p>
<p class="text"> The Scientometric Analysis of AI for Wind Energy can be applied to predicting wind turbine power output and performance assessment. Such techniques have in the last few years been outperformed by more sophisticated algorithms, especially utilising deep learning, especially by using deep learning techniques. There has been a recent interest in utilising Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series SCADA features and meteorological parameters. The study shows that such approaches are promising for load response prediction, and can be extended to new turbine sites, accounting for available wind resource assessment data. </p>
<p class="text"> RNNs can account for past temporal information, making them competent for processing data with sequential nature. In machine learning, classiﬁcation techniques are an integral aspect of classifying/segregating two or more categorical variables e.g. Fault types in diﬀerent turbine sub-components. LSTMs have been used over the last decade for analysing, diagnosing and predicting wind turbine faults. The paper demonstrates that decision tree algorithms like random forest can measure and parameterise the importance of SCADA signals, which can be extremely useful.<br/> This is likely the only paper in the area of utilising ML techniques for fault prediction to propose a complete solution right from model development and training to its deployment on a cloud server with a front-end dashboard. The paper mentions that the trained predictive models were not updated to adapt to the actual operational status of the turbines. Despite the promise, the study does not provide any details regarding performance metrics (such as accuracy, prediction speed etc.) of the ensemble-bagged tree classiﬁer. </p>
<p class="text"> Scientometric Analysis of AI for Wind Energy proposes the interfacing of predictive decision tree model with a distributed data storage cloud server. The proposed framework can help provide autonomous decision support with simple and easy to interpret models like decision trees. However, utilising more sophisticated AI models (especially deep learners) for real-time decision support would likely lead to added complexity and challenges in deployment in the wind industry, which they believe is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in the near future. Figure 11 outlines the evolution of trend topics in data-driven decision making in wind industry with time. </p>
<p class="text"> Some studies have applied AI in computer vision techniques for fault diagnosis and indications of incipient failures in external turbine sub-components. The paper demonstrates the immense promise which AI provides in optimising turbine topologies, as AI algorithms can take into account an exponential number of cases and distributions for optimal solutions, which is generally infeasible through manual optimisation techniques. However, as deviation from ideal signals might not always be indicative of a fault, this approach can often raise false alarms, inadvertently causing forced outages and increased costs.<br/> Andersen et al. have utilised convolutional neural networks (CNN) for multi-class fault prediction using vibrational signals from turbines. The paper demonstrates highly promising results, with CNN outperforming conventional ML techniques used as baselines signiﬁcantly. In a closely related study, Kong and Kong developed a hybrid model consisting of CNNs along with Gated recurrent units (GRUs) for fusing spatio-temporal SCADA features. Similar to LSTMs, GRUs are able to learn temporal dependencies in complex and non-linear SCADA data, while utilising fewer training parameters. </p>
<p class="text"> CNN-GRU model was trained using historical data for normal behavithe of turbines. Any deviation from normal operation in terms of residuals was utilised to detect anomalies. The paper demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of the method for anomaly-prediction, especially as a monitoring indicator during CBM. While these studies show such deep learners can predict faults with high accuracy, they cannot provide rationales and transparency in their decisions, regarding the features exactly leading to the predicted faults <br/> Some studies have employed Explainable AI models to tackle the issue of transparency. Chatterjee and Dethlefs used the top 15 terms(logarithmic scale) prevalent in cited papers utilising such models are used. The list of terms used in these papers are used in the context of the study. The most common terms used are “sympathetic’, ‘transparent’ and ‘disparative’. ‘sympathy’. </p>
<p class="text"> Scientometric Analysis of AI for Wind Energy utilised a hybrid model consisting of LSTMs along with a Gradient-boosted decision tree classiﬁer (XGBoost) This study also demonstrated the feasibility of transfer-learning, facilitating prediction of faults in new domains (e.g. wind farms which have not been in operation for long) without access to historically labelled failure data. Figure 12 shows the top 15 keywords in publications applying AI for CBM, which have received the strongest citations in the wind industry. Figure 13 depicts the composition of these less popular techniques.<br/> The least frequent keywords in cited papers used in CBM publications utilising such models are used. These records (generally) are generally historical logs of alarms/failures. The most commonly used keywords are ‘human-intelligible’ and ‘synthetic language’s’, ‘language-generation’. ‘Human-intelligent’ is a key phrase in AI models. It is used to generate data-driven decision support. </p>
<p class="text"> SCADA data contains comprehensive information of the historical faults in turbines in the form of natural language phrases describing the alarms in turbine sub-components (e.g. pitch system, gearbox, yaw etc.) and time-stamps for the events in relation to the SCADA features. NLG can often play a critical role in shortening analysis time frames in O&M decision support as well as providing human-intelligible deci-naissancesions. The purpose of data-driven decision making and automated planning is more or less defeated if AI models are not able to provide maintenance action suggestions.<br/> Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen some application in the wind industry for autonomous decision making and planning. They believe it is vital to utilise NLG models, especially leveraging deep learning to generate human-intelligible maintenance reports for O&M. They believe that more research should be pursued in this domain to provide better planning and/or optimisation of turbines as a system is often critical to optimisation and control of turbines. They hope to use reinforcement learning to help us understand complex environ-forming environments of wind turbines. </p>
<p class="text"> Figure 14 shows network visualisation of all AI publications in the last decade, outlining the stagnant rise of AI for CBM in the wind industry. There is prevalence of predictive techniques for classiﬁcation, regression and optimisation tasks with neural networks and signal processing techniques (e.g. wavelet transform) and power curves being used for such a number of purposes. The wind industry is facing an interesting and challenging problem in autonomous prediction and scheduling of O&M using data-driven techniques. </p>
<p class="text"> Data availability and quality ensurance of AI techniques rely on huge amounts of data for optimal decision making in real-world applications. Most wind farm operators are reluctant to share commercially sensitive nature of data from wind turbines, which is vital for researchers. However, the most wind farm data is readily available in the public domain, which can be used for per-formance assessment of turbines. The study uses open-source datasets in the wind energy sector to analyse the impact of AI on wind turbines. </p>
<p class="text"> Only two of the above sources of data contain historical logs of alarms and failures. SCADA datasets containing labelled history of alarms prove to be more useful in applying AI techniques. However, unsupervised AI techniques for outlier detection can be applied to discover hidden patterns in the SCADA features and identify potential faults based on discriminatory features. This is often more reliable, as per-formance metrics (e.g. accuracy) can be obtained given that original labels (normal operation/anomaly) are available. They present a summary of some openly-available datasets which can be utilised for CBM.<br/> Wind industry has witnessed very limited attention in identifying key issues that persist with utilising turbine data, which is particularly vital for training AI models which rely on accurate and scalable data. Data quality issues aﬀect not only fault diagnostics and diagnostics in CBM, but also additional O&M tasks which may be beyond the scope of CBM but could be vital to performance assessment. With continuing developments in the wind industry, big data with high resolution and complexity are becoming available from lidars and buoys, wind and wave metrics. </p>
<p class="text"> Data-to-text generation systems utilise natural language generation (NLG) techniques for generating human-intelligible textual descriptions of failures from structured SCADA data. In the wind industry, the alarm messages available are often of inadequate quality for training NLG models to achieve human-level intelligence. Lack of sufficient diversity in data samples is essential for generating coherent text and providing useful insights. Lack in diversity of available corpus makes utilising NLG in decision support challenging for wind industry. In other potential uses of contextual failure information, the context may include thorough details presented in the form of service logs for turbines, which can be instrumental in contextualising rarer faults and new errors witnessed by maintenance personnel<br/> Wind energy sector may focus to tackle challenges in data availability and quality. Encouraging more wind farm operators to provide open data to train AI models. Data can be used to train the decision making models over more diverse scenarios of the wind industry. All these aspects thereby directly contribute to human-intelligible and informative decision making, which can be integral for O&M in the wind energy industry. They believe that there are multiple options which the industry may focus on to tackle the challenges. </p>
<p class="text"> The wind industry has seen very limited application of transfer learning techniques in comparison to applications in other domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. They envisage that a wider adoption of such techniques in the wind industry can help in enhancing the uptake of AI for CBM and contribute towards making the O&M process more dependable in situations with paucity of data. They believe that as wind turbines suﬀer degradation and are decommissioned after the end of their useful life, they believe that historical data can help facilitate development and training of AI models. </p>
<p class="text"> Data from turbines often consists of noise and outliers (e.g. power production at zero wind speed) resulting from communication failures, abnormality in equipments etc. This poses signiﬁcant challenges in utilising such information to train AI models. They believe that there is insuﬃcient investment in monitoring, development and analysis of the data. By adopting uni-scientific standards and investing in this area, they envisage that the wind industry can beneשּׁ�troublegreatly in terms of Return on Investment (ROI)<br/> They believe that the wind industry needs to focus on more widely adopting oversampling techniques, to facilitate informative decision making. The optimal solution is to focus more on increasing the diversity of contextual information on faults. Specialised NLG techniques such as few-shot learning can be utilised to facilitate NLG even in situations with limited availability of high quality training datasets. Such models can be ﬁne-tuned with custom data from small corpuses and help overcome the challenges posed by inadequate availability (and quality) of alarm messages. </p>
<p class="text"> The wind industry needs to focus on optimally utilising every type of relevant and useful datasets to facilitate decision making under constraints of complex, unorganised and low-quality O&M records. This is necessary until better quality datasets are available in the wind industry, which they believe can likely only be achieved with a long-term perspective, given the challenges in transitioning from traditional data acquisition methods to high-quality storage and information retrieval, e.g. through cloud data centres. Table 4summarises the emerging data quality issues the industry is starting to witness in recent times, along with possible strategies to facilitate informative decision making. </p>
<p class="text"> Some promising AI models have been made in the wind industry for deploying decision-support models in real-time environments Some studies have outlined techniques which can be utilised for interfacing turbine sensors and actuators with the internet and cloud. The paper mentions that the key barriers limiting the practical realisation and wider deployment of IoT in wind industry are lack of budget and skills. Other barriers which the paper mentions include security concerns, challenges with communication protocols and challenges with communicating with communication. </p>
<p class="text"> The availability of continuous information e.g. in the form of SCADA features is not a major challenge for real-time machine learning, as most wind farm operators have placed immense emphasis on developing e.ective and eﬀcient data logging and processing systems on cloud servers. The major challenge which the wind industry faces is the growing complexity of such datasets, which, due to lack of uniﬁed standards, are diﬃcult to be utilised for inference with trained AI models. Thereby, only utilising simplified/shower models is clearly not a viable solution to tackle these challenges. </p>
<p class="text"> The lack of rationales behind decisions made by the AI models makes wind turbine operators reluctant to adopt data-driven decision making techniques and focus on more traditional methods based on signal processing and numerical physics models. They believe that it is essential to incorporate trust in the decisions that are made by black-box AI to explainable AI as discussed below. For models which have not been applied till date, prospective applications are outlined here. For wind farm operators, wind turbine turbine owners may be reluctant to use AI models to make decisions based on traditional methods such as signal processing or numerical physics. </p>
<p class="text"> A non-iterative and non-parametric deep learning (xDNN) deep learning architecture combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. The attention mechanism allows LSTMs to focus on vital parts of input sequences, providing easier and higher quality learning. Attention weights can provide transparency in key features which cause LSTM to generate its predictions. An AI model based on local explainations through game theory approach. Provides explanations based on prob-pro-ability density function automatically learnt from data distribution. </p>
<p class="text"> Figure 17 shows the trends for utilising various Explainable AI models for data-driven decision making in the wind industry. The current applications mostly focus on turbine power prediction, while limited attention has been received in the area of predicting faults and maintenance actions in O&M. Table 6 summarises some of the major XAI models which have been applied in wind industry, along with other prospective models for potential future applications. XAI can contribute to improved performance of AI models as explanations help trace issues and pitfalls in datasets and the behaviors of features. </p>
<p class="text"> Figure 18 shows a graphical roadmap summarising the likely future of utilising AI for decision support in O&M in the wind industry over the next 5 years. Table 7 shows the major focus areas for the next few years, including Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Big Data (for tackling data availability and quality issues) and Deployment (for ﬁnal deployment of AI models) Table 7 provides a summary of all papers reviewed in the study, including the techniques they use, key applications and key applications, along with their limitations wherever applicable. </p>
<p class="text"> Researchers have provided a systematic review of the past, present and future of data-driven decision making techniques in the wind energy domain. The study shows that the study of AI applied in wind energy domains is still in its embryonic stages compared to advances that other disciplines, such as signal processing, are still in their infancy. The authors conclude that the wind industry would take more time to improve the data quality and adopt HPC & Cloud Computing techniques widely. However, adoption of IoT for real-time decision support will likely not be realised soon, as there are ongoing challenges and concerns on data security and privacy. </p>
<p class="text"> Scientometric Analysis of AI for Wind Energy provides an analysis of future roadmap for the wind energy industry. They outline the key challenges faced by the wind industry, particularly lack of access to quality data, problems in deploying AI models for real-time decision making, and the issue of transparency in black-box natured AI models. They show that is vital to focus on more sophisticated and tailored AI algorithms, especially with deep learning and natural language generation techniques for explainable AI in achieving human-intelligible, trustworthy decision making. </p>
