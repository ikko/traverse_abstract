They show the following results. In the results, they show that the problem is solved by factorization matrices. They also show that factorization problems are solved by using a factorization matrix of matrices with a polynomic matrix. They conclude that the result is the result of factorizing matrices matrices for a linear algebra matrices. They then conclude that this is a result of the factization problem.</p></a>

The value of a game such as $c = c (c)>0$ is at most $n^{-c$ and $n = c(\mathcal G) >0$.</p></a>

They investigate the round complexity of the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on circulant graphs, i.e. on Cayley graphs of the cyclic group. They prove that the number of rounds until stabilization is bounded by $d(n)$. As a particular consequence, the problem can be tested in NC for connected circularant graphs of order $p^\ell$ with $p$ an odd prime.</p></a>

They characterize the complexity of universal traversal, where the goal is to traverse every gadget at least once, for DAG gadgets, one-state gadgets, and reversible deterministic gadgets. They also study the. complexity of reconfiguration, where. the goal. is to bring the system of gadgets to a specified state, proving many cases PSPACE-complete.</p></a>

In each case, they prove that the generalized game with that mechanic is polynomial, NP-complete or NP-hard. In the process they give an overview of many of the hardness proof techniques developed for video games over the past decade: the motion-planning-through-gadgets framework, the planar doors framework, and the collectible tokens and toll roads / Hamiltonicity framework.</p></a>

Such a tree defines a Boolean function in a natural way. They focus on the randomized decision tree complexity of such functions. They prove lower bounds of the form $c(k,n)^d$, where $d$ is the depth of the tree. They also treat trees with alternating levels of AND and OR gates separately and show asymptotically optimal bounds.</p></a>

This problem is known as empirical risk minimization in the machine learning community. They show that the problem is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete. This complexity class can be defined as the set of algorithmic problems that are polynomial-time equivalent to finding real roots of a polynomorphic polynomic with integer coefficients.</p></a>

They prove that hardness holds even over instances where words have length $k = 5$, and that even in this case it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of guesses required to guarantee discovering the secret word. They also present results regarding its parameterized complexity and offer some related open problems.</p></a>

They consider bag-TIDBs where they have a bound $c$ on the maximum multiplicity of each tuples. They develop a sampling algorithm that computes a 1$\pm\epsilon$ approximation of an output tuples in time linear in the runtime of the corresponding deterministic query for any $RA^+$ query. They proceed to study approximation of expected result tuples multiplicities for positive relational algebra queries ($RA*+$) over c-TIDS.</p></a>

They contribute to a broader view on path finding by injecting a natural fairness aspect. They seek to find short paths where all colors should appear with roughly the same frequency. Among other results, they prove the introduced problems to be computationally hard (NP-hard and parameterized hard with respect to the number of colors), while also presenting an encouraging algorithmic result ("fixed-parameter tractability") related to the length of the sought solution path"</p></a>
