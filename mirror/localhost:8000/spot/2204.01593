                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">patches of a WSI in a prediction model may not produce optimal prediction performance. Certain image regions/patches within the WSI (e.g., tumor) could carry more predictive value and improve the prediction performance of the model. Unsupervised clustering has been widely used to reduce the dimensionality of patches to facilitate multiple instance learning.
 Unsupervised clustering has been commonly used in image-based deep-learning survival analysis. Dooley et al and Zhu et al clustered patches into different clusters, and used frequency of patches in each cluster as a new feature of WSIs for heart transplant rejection classification.
 Sharma et aldeployed a cluster-based (clustering patches from a single WSI) sampling approach for classifying patches. Sharma and Sharma used a cluster of patches from one WSI sampling approach to classify patches. The results were published in a journal journal journal today&#39;s edition of the journal Nature Select.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">The approach performed better than other approaches in modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) A few studies have been performed to use unsupervised clustering to select and identify image agicallypatches to optimize the prediction of gene mutations.
 Unsupervised clustering can enhance the model prediction ability by dividing the image into different areas, assisting in tissue type annotation, and selecting the most predictive image patches. The method was applied to WSIs from three cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) WSI dataset was available at the TCGA portal. Data and subtype data were downloaded from the website https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/Datasets were obtained for three tumor types, namely colorectal (COAD and READ)
 Macenko’s method was used to normalize the color of patches synchronously. For LUAD, HNSCC, and CRC, the number of patches extracted from the images ranged from &lt;100 to 50,000 (average = 12,664) for each patch. A feature vector with a dimension of 256 was extracted from each patch for each patient.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">They are the first to predict mutations using unsupervised clustering. They randomly selected 100 patients from each of the three tumor types (LUAD, HNSCC, and CRC) in TCGA dataset. After pooling all patches from 100 patients of each cancer type, they used K-means clustering to cluster patches into fthe groups.
 A k-NN algorithm was used to assign cluster labels to the rest of the patches of that cancer type. A classifier trained a patch-level multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier that used the features of the patch only in each cluster as the input to estimate the size of each cluster.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">All the patches from a WSI were used to train a patch-level network. The average predicted probability of patches was used to predict slide-level mutation and the mutation probability of each patch. They also trained an MIL classifier using all patches from patients without clustering the patches.
 For CRC, they selected tumor tiles using a fine-tuned Xception-based tissue-type classifier trained mutation prediction models on tumor patches. They compared the performance of these models with BCOMIL-based models. In addition, they compared the method with two recently published baseline methods that also used unsupervised clustering.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">Zhu et al: Zhu et aldeveloped an algorithm to use unsupervised clustering to assist development of a deep-learning survival model. The main idea of this method is using K-means cluster instead of manual annotated region, and selecting the effective cluster for the final prediction.
 They used stratified five-fold cross validation according to the mutation status of each gene to divide TCGA dataset into five folds for each cancer type and to avoid data. They concatenated weighted weighted weighted feature from selected clusters, then trained a SVM classifier for mutation prediction.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">80% of the data were used for model training and 20% for model validation. They used Adam optimization with an initial learning rate of 0.00005, a cosine annealing schedule with maximum number of iterations of 20 and training and validation were done over 1000 iterations. They assigned more weight to classes with a small number of training images.
 The overall accuracy of the tissue-type classification model was 99% based on the training dataset NCT-CRC-HE-100K and 94.4%. The tissue type of each image tile from the TCGA dataset was predicted using the fine-tuned Xception-based tissue type classifier. For LUAD and HNSCC, they developed a semi-automatic procedure to assist pathologists’ annotated annotations.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">K-means clustered the tiles into fthe distinct clusters for the three TCGA datasets (LUAD, HNSCC, and CRC) for each cancer type. Pathologists annotated 64 patches (out of a total of 5,496,176 patches for LUAD, 5,504,732 patches for HNScc, and 3,265,632 patches for CRC.
 Figures 4-6 show the image tiles representing the most common tissue type among the fthe neighborhood patches near the center of each subcluster for LUAD, HNSCC, and CRC, respectively. Figure 4 shows the fthe subclusters for each cluster, each with fthe different tissue types.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">For CRC, they examined the tissue types of each cluster using the CRC tissue type classifier. Cluster 1 was mainly consist of tumor and mucin cells, while all patches in Cluster 2 were tumor cells. Cluster 3 of CRC primarily included muscular and stromal cells with some debris and tumor cells as well.
 The mutant-like image features for TP53 and STK11 may be mainly contained in the tumor regions. It is consistent with the findings from Coudray et alTumor cells also predicted EGFR mutation well (Table 2) Stromal cells in Cluster 4 provided the highest AUC for prediction of ALK gene mutation.

                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">For HNSCC, a remarkable difference in AUC for prediction of gene mutations was observed for different clusters. The tumor cells (Cluster 4) provided high predictive ability for TP53, HRAS, CASP8, and NSD1. The models based on non-tumor cells (including blood vessel, debris, etc.) in Cluster 2 outperformed the other three clusters.
 Features from both Cluster 1 (primarily tumor and mucin tissues) and Cluster 4 (a mixture of all types of tissues) had a better predictive performance for the vast majority of the genes. The image features best predicted PIK3CA, ATM, BRAF, and MET genes with AUC &gt; 0.7.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">An image tile with normal-tissue-like features had the highest likelihood of PIK3CA mutation (Figure 10) The image tiles demonstrated in Cluster 4 lymphocytes most likely related to ERBB2, ATM, and MET mutations. The improvement of the average AUC from the cross validations was up to 0.08 (Figure 11b)
 In lung adenocarcinoma, a remarkable improvement of AUC (AUC) was observed for STK11 (0.061), ALK (0.051), and KRAS (1.046) For HNSCC, DNAH5 had the most improved AUC; ERBB2 and RET were remarkably improved for CRC genes.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">Figure 13 shows the average AUC of model trained on the best clusters and model trained only on tumor patchesBCOMIL outperformed models trained only on tumor regions. Table 4 shows patches in Cluster 1 (tumor + mucin) and Cluster 4 (a mix of all tissue types) provided more predictive models.
 WSIs are too large (Giga pixels) to fit on a GPU at once, they are usually split into small image patches for training neural networks and prediction models. Since patch-level labels are usually not available, they cannot directly perform classification on each patch.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">It is commonly assumed that tumor regions carry the most predictive information. Unsupervised clustering of image patches helped to identify predictive patches and therefore improved prediction on gene mutations in three different cancer types (LUAD, HNSCC, and CRC from ��TCGA) compared to the approach using all patches from WSIs.
 The proposed algorithm performed two recently published baseline algorithms leveraging unsupervised clustering to assist model prediction. It appears that this hypothesis is true for HNSCC as tumor tissues (Cluster 4) The algorithm performed well against two recent baseline algorithms. It also performed well with the clustering-based deep-learning algorithm.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">For HNSCC, tumor-like image tiles seem to be less predictive for genes ALK, KRAS, and KEAP1. Tumor and mucin tiles (Cluster 1) of CRC as well as a mix of a variety of tissue types better predicted CRC mutations.
 They assumed that a limited number of tissue types are present in WSIs. Repeated clustering of the tiles could separate individual tissue types based on their morphologic appearance. They also demonstrated that unsupervised clustering can help reduce the workload for pathologist-based manual annotation.</p>

                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">Images of three cancer tissues were first downloaded from TCGA and CPTAC databases. Images were preprocessed to remove background areas using a U-net, split into non-overlapping tiles with a size of 224 x 224 pixels. A fine-tuned Xception model-based feature extractor was used to generate patch representations.
 An additional K-means purposefullyclustering (k =4) was performed, and fthe neighborhood patches around the center of each subcluster were selected for pathologists’ annotation. For each cancer, 5,000 patches were randomly selected from each of the fthe clusters.
 The Deep Learning-based unsupervised clustering and mutation predictions are visualized to understand the spatial locations of each cluster, to identify the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores, and to highlight the heterogeneity of a predicted genotype in the tumor microenvironment.
 The heatmap showcases the probability scores of the gene mutations in the identified best cluster. The tile with the highest probability of mutations for each gene is displayed and the corresponding tissue type is provided. Figure 9 visualizes the proposed algorithm for different genes in HNSCC.</p>
