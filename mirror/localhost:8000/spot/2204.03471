              <p class="media-body media-body-page article p1">DynLight: Realize dynamic phase duration with multi-level trafﬁc signal control frame-work, DynLight. DynLight uses an optimization method Max-QueueLength (M-QL) to determine phase and uses a deep-Q-network to determine the corresponding duration. They further propose DynLight-C that adopts a well trained deep-trained deep Q-network of DynLight and replace M-QL by a cyclical control policy that actuate a set of phases in order to realize cyclical phase structure.&lt;br/&gt; Traditional methods for TSC rely on hand-crafted trafﬁc signals. Drivers prefer a cyclical phase structure for traf-centric signals. They develop a multi-level signal control framework DynLight that determines the phase order in the first stage. DynLight can be replaced to realize cyclical-phase actuation to support real-world deployment. With DynLight well trained, the phase selection policy can be. replaced to realized cyclical.phase actuations to support Real-World deployment.</p>

              <p class="media-body media-body-page article  p2">Adaptive control (Lowrie 1992; Hunt et al. 1982) control requires pre-timed cycle length, ﬁed phase sequence, and phase split. Actuated control triggers trafﬁc signal accord-ing to pre-de-deשּׁ�ned rules and real-time data. RL based methods learn to control the signal through in-activelyacting with the environment. RL methods improve the TSC per-formance mainly in three ways: (1) design effective state-or-reward, (2) develop new network structure; (3) intro-agogueduce advanced RL techniques.&lt;br/&gt; Most RL methods use ﬁxed action interval(tduration) and determine phase every tduration. The duration of each phase can only be multiple times the length of the tduration and can’t realize dynamic duration. RL methods cannot work when the phase order is re-quired in a determined order, these methods can&#39;t work because they can determine arbitrary phase. They consider multi-intersection TSC, in which each intersection is controlled by an RL agent. Agent i views the environments as its observation and takes an action to control the signal of intersection i. The goal of the agent i is to take an optimal action to maximize its cumulative reward.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">They train DynLight with cyclical phase selection as DynLight-C. They use two groups (JiNan and HangZhou) of datasets that describe how vehicles travel across the network. The average ar-rival rate of the two datasets are different from each other as shown in Table 2. They conduct comprehensive experiments on CityFlow1, which is open-source and supports large-scale trafﬁc signal-control (Zhang et al. 2019) CityFlow has been wildly used by multiple RL methods such as MPLight, CoLight, and HiLight.
 They compare the proposed methods with the following base-line methods, including traditional and RL TSC methods. Each episode is a 60-minutes simulation, and they adopt one result as the average of the last ten episodes of testing. The average travel time has been wildly used with MPLight (Chen et al. 2020), CoLight (Wei et al., 2019b), and HiLight (Xu et. 2021) They compare the methods to those used by MPLight and CoLight.</p>
              
                  <p class="media-body media-body-page article pn">Overall performance comparison with respect to average travel time, the smaller the better. Table 3 and Figure 3 demonstrate the overall performance of JiNan and HangZhou real-world datasets. DynLight consistently outperforms all other previ-generation methods among JiNAN and Hang Zhou real world datasets. The performance difference is signiﬁcant. DynLight achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for. trafשּׁcipient-signal control. Dynlight-C demonstrates high.performance.</p>
