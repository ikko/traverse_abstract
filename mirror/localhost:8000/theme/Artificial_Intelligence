                      <p class="media-body"> Videos are created to express emotion, exchange information, and share experiences. Video synthesis has intrigued researchers for a long time. But little progress has been made in generating longer videos. They present a method that builds on 3D-VQGAN and transformers to generate videos with thousands of frames. The evaluation shows that the model trained on 16-frame video clips from standard benchmarks such as UCF-101, Sky Time-lapse, and Taichi-HD datasets can generate diverse, coherent, and high-quality long videos.</p>

                      <img class="media-object" src="/html/images/_pdf_2204.03571.png"/>
                      <p class="media-body"> Negative sequence analysis (NSA) is to discover negative sequential patterns (NSPs) consisting of important non-occurring and occurring elements and patterns. The limited existing work on NSP mining relies on frequentist and downward closure property-based pattern selection, producing large and redundant NSPs, nonactionable for business decision-making. This work makes the first attempt for actionable NSP discovery. It builds an NSP graph representation, quantify both explicit occurrence-based element and pattern relations.</p>

                      <p class="media-body"> Abstraction is a commonly used process to represent some low-level system by a more coarse specification. They describe an approach to abstraction of probabilistic and dynamic systems. They obtain abstract Golog programs that omit unnecessary details and which can be translated back to a detailed program for actual execution. This simplifies the implementation of noisy robot programs, opens up the possibility of using deterministic reasoning methods (e.g., planning) on probabilism problems, and provides domain descriptions that are more easily understandable and explainable.</p>

                      <h2>Temporal Alignment for History Representation in Reinforcement Learning</h2>
                      <img class="media-object" src="/html/images/_pdf_2204.03525.png"/>
                      <p class="media-body"> Inspired by human memory, they propose to represent history with only important changes in the environment. The method (TempAl) aligns temporally-close frames, revealing a general, slowly varying state of the environment. TempAl surpasses the instantaneous-only baseline in 35 environments out of 49. TempAl is based on contrastive loss, which pulls embeddings of nearby observations to each other while pushing away other samples from the batch. It can be interpreted as a metric that captures the temporal relations of observations.</p>

                      <img class="media-object" src="/html/images/_pdf_2204.03471.png"/>
                      <p class="media-body"> Adopting reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is increasingly popular. Most RL methods use fixed action interval (denoted as tduration) and actuate or maintain a phase every tduration, which makes the phase duration less dynamic and flexible. They propose DynLight-C that adopts a well trained deep Q-network of DynLight and replace M-QL by a fixed cyclical control policy that actuate a set of phases in fixed order to realize cyclical phase structure.</p>
