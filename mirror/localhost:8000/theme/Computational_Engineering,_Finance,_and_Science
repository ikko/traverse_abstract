                      <p class="media-body"> An efficient computer model is a vital step towards tissue engineering, enhancing the research of coronary diseases, and developing medical treatment and interventional tools. Disorders of coronary arteries lead to severe health problems such as atherosclerosis, angina, heart attack and even death. The result is an IUQ methodology to calibrate a model with uncertain parameters and a microscale agent-based model of arterial tissue, which produces mechanical behavithe in line with the experimental data, according to the authors of the study.</p>

                      <h2>Parallel Power System Restoration</h2>
                      <img class="media-object" src="/html/images/_pdf_2204.01837.png"/>
                      <p class="media-body"> Power system restoration is an essential activity for grid resilience, where grid operators restart generators, re-establish transmission paths, and restore loads after a blackout event. The core decisions in restoration planning are to partition the grid into a few sub-networks, each of which has an initial power source for black-start (called sectionalization problem) and then restart the generators and pick up the loads in each network (called generator startup sequencing problem or GSS) in a parallel fashion, aiming to restore electric service in shortest time.</p>

                      <p class="media-body"> They employ a recently proposed change-point detection algorithm, the Narrowest-Over-Threshold (NOT) method, to select subperiods of past observations that are similar to the currently recorded values. Then, contrarily to the traditional time series approach in which the most recent observations are taken as the calibration sample, they estimate autoregressive models only for data in these sub periods. They observe a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy compared to commonly used approaches, including the Autoregressive Hybrid Nearest Neighbors (ARHNN)</p>
