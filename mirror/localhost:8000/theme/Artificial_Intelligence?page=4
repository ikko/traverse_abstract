                      <p class="media-body"> Representing some problems with XOR clauses (parity constraints) can allow to apply more efficient reasoning techniques. In this paper, they present a gadget for translating SAT clauses into Max2XOR constraints, i.e. xOR clauses of at most 2 variables equal to zero or to one.</p>

                      <img class="media-object" src="/html/images/_pdf_2204.01620.png"/>
                      <p class="media-body"> Industrial transfer learning increases adaptability of deep learning algorithms towards heterogenous and dynamic industrial use cases without high manual efforts. The appropriate selection of what to transfer can vastly improve a transfer&#39;s results. The BIRCH algorithm is selected for this purpose. Results underline the approaches&#39; applicability caused by its results&#39; reproducibility and practical indifference to sequence, size and dimensionality of (sub-)datasets to be clustered sequentially.</p>

                      <h2>Optimize Deep Learning Models for Prediction of Gene Mutations Using Unsupervised Clustering</h2>
                      <img class="media-object" src="/html/images/_pdf_2204.01593.png"/>
                      <p class="media-body"> Deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for analyzing and interpreting whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs) It is commonly assumed that tumor regions carry most predictive information. They proposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply the method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations using WSIs from three cancer types.
 The unsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows identification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores. Other tissue types in the tumor micro-environment may provide better prediction ability for gene mutations than tumor tissues.</p>
